## Welcome to my corner of the internet!!

#### This website's been through MANY redesigns and here we finally are!
I started with using a CSS framework called [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for design. Then, I decided to write my own CSS and after a couple of versions, settled on the current design.

#### Thanks to â€”
The website was made possible all thanks to:
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for the initial CSS framework
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for most of the pictures used
- [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) for the customized AA favicon
- [Opengraphs](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) to fix up my meta tags
- [Scrollama](https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/): A JavaScript library I used to create scrolly-story experiences
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) to edit graphs
- [Raw Graphs](https://rawgraphs.io/)
