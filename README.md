Thank you for checking out my website! Here's all about it:

## Tech stack/resources

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Free Icons](https://freeicons.io/)

## Why?
Because I obviously need a portfolio website, but more importantly because I wanted a space I could use as a playground -if you will, to practice, experiment and showcase my programming skills.
