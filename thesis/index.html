    <div class="center-content">
        <p>In 2021, New York City’s residents — over eight million people — received the city’s first ever flash flood
            emergency alert. The cause? Two weeks of rain totaling a little over eight inches.</p>
        <p>The storms followed Hurricane Ida just a week earlier which had killed 46 people in the north east, and at
            least 16 in the city. Most of these deaths happened in basement apartments. The city has X number of them,
            housing Y people.</p>
        <p>The first stormwater rule was established in response to a federal stormwater management ruling in 1990. The
            scope of the ruling was broadened to include more sites — smaller, private ones — in 2003. Phase two of
            stormwater regulations included all areas with over at least an acre of disturbance. </p>
        <p>“It’s becoming more evident as time passes that there is a greater need for stormwater management practices
            that are technically effective and viable in New York State,” NG Kaul, Water Division director wrote in a
            2001 stormwater management design manual report.</p>
        <p>About two thirds of the city is covered in concrete leaving little permeable surface. Further urban
            development only makes water management more difficult — including both stormwater and sewage. The 2001
            stormwater management manual noted that as more urbanization occurs, an increased amount of rainwater is
            directly converted into stormwater. A one-acre parking lot can produce 16 times more stormwater runoff than
            a one-acre meadow each year, the report noted.</p>
        <h3>Insert section on increased amount of runoff because of more rain – data for rain events and inches of rain
            each year.</h3>
        <p>The problem isn’t just limited to an increased amount of rain. Stormwater runoff also harms water quality in
            the city. In storm events, which are increasingly more frequent, runoff collects pollutants that then end up
            in the city’s canals.</p>
        <p>One such is Brooklyn’s nearly 2-mile-long Gowanus Canal which empties into the New York Harbor. The canal was
            used for domestic shipping in the 19th century, causing it to get heavily polluted. Even as most industrial
            activity stopped by the 20th century, the pollutants remained. There is currently a $1.5 billion federal
            Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cleanup underway at Gowanus. The work began in November last year to
            dredge the main channel of the canal south of the Carroll Street bridge.</p>
        <p>The canal has over a dozen contaminants, including heavy metals, mercury, lead, and copper in high levels,
            according to a press release by the EPA. Industrial activity and sewer overflow are considered responsible
            for the contaminants. </p>
