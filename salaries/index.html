        <h1>As retirement nears, some city officials clock in
            more overtime
        </h1>
        <p>Between 2017 and 2021, New York City employees clocked in more hours in overtime — sometimes even more than
            regular hours —as they neared 20 years of service. Over 100 employees, now retired, worked more in overtime
            than regular hours from just three agencies.
        </p>
        <p>The city knows it has a problem with overtime pay — across different agencies and different levels of pay.
            Aware of this phenomenon that has crippled state coffers at least for a decade, some nonprofit watchdog
            organizations, like Citizen Budget Commission (CBC), noted that this pattern is common as employees near 20
            years of service when they become eligible for voluntary retirement.
        </p>
        <p>Pension “is based on what your salary is at the point of separation”, explained Ana Champeny, the research
            director at Citizen Budget Commission (CBC), a nonprofit watchdog organization focused on city’s budgeting
            and finances.
        </p>
        <p>In the five-year period, the city spent over a billion dollars each year on overtime. Broken down by
            agencies, the three uniformed ones — New York Police, Fire Department, and Department of Correction spent
            the most. And, even though the total spending on overtime hasn’t changed significantly over these years, it
            still poses a problem, Champeny said. “I think it's still a significant amount of spending and poses some
            questions: Is there a more efficient way to work so you’re not spending too much on overtime?”
        </p>
        <p>The pattern is especially prevalent in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
        </p>
        <p>One employee particularly, a special assignment lieutenant, earned over $300,000 in overtime pay in the
            five-year period. Before retiring, he clocked in over 2,400 hours in overtime. This is the same as working
            10 extra hours everyday, during a period of five days a week, for one whole year. Doing so, he earned
            $162,000 in overtime pay in 2020 alone, payroll data shows.
        </p>
        <p>While the Department of Corrections has far fewer employees, compared to NYPD — nearly 68,000, it is one of
            the highest spenders in terms of overtime pay. The department also has some of the highest number of
            employees working more overtime than regular hours. Twenty three corrections’ officers worked more than
            1,500 hours in overtime in a given year.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike the NYPD, over one third have worked for DOC employees have worked for less than ten years, data
            shows. About 81% are currently deployed in Queens, the borough that encompassed the origin of most of last
            year's overtime for the agency.
        </p>
        <p>Most notably, a warden assistant for the agency clocked in 3,147 hours in overtime in 2020, in addition to
            working 2,040 hours in regular hours. A similar behavior is seen among a bunch of captains and corrections
            officers.
        </p>
        <p>It’s not just uniformed agencies that present this pattern, Champaney said. “You’ll see the pattern for some
            skilled trades too, which includes plumbers and electricians for instance.” Last January the city’s public
            housing agency, NYCHA, fired 18 workers after probing overtime abuse, The City reported, and it's currently
            investigating 60 other public officials.
        </p>
        <p>Champeny also added that overtime often costs the city more than what is budgeted for, and, there’s no “good
            answer” to why the city doesn’t budget more realistically. Watchdog agencies like Champeny’s also vouches
            for the city to control spending in general with better “management controls” on overtime, she added.
        </p>
        <p>It’s not just overtime that may raise eyebrows. For some employees, the dataset shows negative regular hours
            which could be an accounting method to capture payments these employees owe to the city, according to Robert
            Callaha, a budget and labor issues analyst at the New York City Independent Budget Office.
        </p>
        <p>Like Callahan, Champeny too said that these negative hours are often adjustments made for accounting
            purposes. “It’s raw, dirty data,” he added.
