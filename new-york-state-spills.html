<p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-align: left">Westchester reports most number of hazardous spill incidents in New York</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: rgb(100, 99, 99); font-weight: bold; text-align: left">Albany reports most amount of stuff spilled</p>
<br>
<p style = "font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 18px; color: black;">In the last five years, New York recorded over 61,000 hazardous material spills across the state. Of the 72 counties from the state included in the dataset, Westchester had the most number of spill incidents recorded. But, when it comes to counties with the biggest spills by quantity of material spilled, Albany leads the way!

<br> <br>
Fuel and transformer oil were the most common materials spilled. While many reported incidents are minor and are cleaned up without any damage, in some other instances, spillage may seep through the soil, eventually entering groundwater and "can make water supplies unsafe to drink," according to the dataset's <a href="file:///Users/areena.arora/Downloads/NYSDEC_SpillIncidents_Overview.pdf" target="_blank">documentation provided by the city.</a> The biggest spill in the last five years happened in August 2017 when over a hundred billion pounds of food waste spilled, affecting the air. It happened in a landfill in Colonie in Albany. The database doesn't give out its cause or any other additional details.

<br><br>
Three more incidents were found the same facility each with major spillage quantities. All these spills, when cross-referenced with the detailed spill incidents search database reportedly affected the air with odor. No further details were reported on the database. The town of Colonie's population is over 83,000, according to its website. It's about 160 miles north of New York City.

For New Yorkers, closer to home, the biggest spill happened in November last year in Jamaica, Queens. Over three million gallons of jet fuel spilled affecting the soil in the area. Digging deeper into incidents in Queens, jet fuel from airports seem to be the biggest troublemaker. Some incidents are listed to have had "deliberate"

<br><br>
We also looked at the number of days it takes to close incident complaints. Some of the longest ones were well over a thousand days, but there's no reason listed for the delay. The quantity of spillage doesn't seem to matter, with the longest incident record being one about a gallon worth of petroleum spillage in Cayuga county. The clean up process involves hiring a contractor by the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
<br> <br>
Another interesting phenomenon observed from the dataset â€” most spills occured in August and July. More specifically, most spills in a single month happened in August 2020.

<br><br>
In Niagra, Chemung and Erie counties, commercial or industrial spillage is the biggest culprit.

</p>
<br><br>
<p style = "font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 18px; color: black;">The dataset doesn't include what happenes to recovered hazardous materials neither does it speak to the affects of materials that remain suspended in natural resources like air and groundwater. The dataset also doesn't include information on number of people affected by the spills.
<br><br>
The difference between incident and close data for some spills is over a thousand days, which is worth digging deeper into. The top five spills with the longest gap between incident and close date have really low quantities of material spilled raising questions as to why it took so long to close these incident files.
