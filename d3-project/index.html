        <h1>Exploring NYC payroll data with D3</h1>
        <p>New York City's payroll dataset is one I'm familiar with and have <a
                href="https://areenaarora.com/salaries/">written in detail about it too.</a> For this project however, I
            wanted to see how much easier D3 makes my life (hint: It did not).</p>
        <p>I can now say I know (ish) JavaScript a bit and thanks to this exercise, I understand D3's syntax better. All
            these charts were made possible thanks to <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/"><span
                    class="highlighted-words">The D3 Graph Gallery!</span></a>
        <p>In reporting on this data previously, I learned that some agencies spend way more than others on overtime
            pay— for various reasons.</p>
        <p>This first chart here shows the same! Here, I've plotted overtime spending by agencies in 2021.</p>
        <div id="dataviz"></div>
        <p>New York Police Department spent close to $500 million in just overtime across all its employees. The next
            highest was the Fire Department at a little under $300 million.</p>
        <p>For this second chart, I've plotted number of years of service on the x-axis and overtime hours worked on the
            y-axis.</p>
        <p>The color of the bubbles corresponds to the agency the employee works for. For this chart, I've only plotted
            employees who made over $200,000 in total pay in 2021 from the top three agencies that spend the most on
            overtime.</p>
        <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
        <h2><b>The chart that didn't quite work:</b></h2>
        <p>This chart was meant to show gross salary and overtime pay. The x-axis shows gross base salary and y-axis
            shows overtime pay. Some employees in the $90,000 to $130,000 gross salary range made over $100,000 in just
            overtime.</p>
