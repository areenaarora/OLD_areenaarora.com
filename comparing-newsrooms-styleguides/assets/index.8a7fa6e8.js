We may use some abbreviations for brevity but never at the expense of clarity. A reader should never have to read backwards to find out what an abbreviation means. Use a generic term,e.g. the company or the organisation, rather than stud a story with abbreviations, especially where more than one or two sets of initials are involved.Space constraints on alerts and headlines make it tempting to invent new short forms for words and create company names, but a better and more accurate headline is almost always possible. It is not acceptable to change the spelling of a proper company name. An abbreviation, if widely known, should be used instead, e.g. IBM not Intl Bus. Mach.. Some very common abbreviations, e.g. AIDS, NATO, may be used alone at first reference with the full name given subsequently. These are listed in the quick reference entries. Abbreviations of two initials take full stops, e.g. U.S. and U.N. The exceptions are EU (European Union) and UK (United Kingdom). The full stops may be omitted in alerts and headlines if there are space constraints. Abbreviations of three or more initials and acronyms (words composed of initials or initial syllables) do not take full stops, e.g. IBM, UNICEF, WEU. If initials are well known, e.g. PLO, you need not bracket the initials after the first full reference. You may write The Palestine Liberation Organisation has sent two envoys ... and then a PLO statement said the two men would ... If the institution is little known, bracket the initials after the first reference, e.g. The Western European Union (WEU) decided on Tuesday. In the case of foreign groups, where the word order changes in the English translation, bracket the initials, e.g. the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Do not bracket initials after a first reference if you are not going to use the initials again lower in the story. Form the plural of abbreviations by adding a lower-case s without an apostrophe, e.g. ICBMs not ICBM s or ICBMS. Do not use full stops when abbreviating the names of months in datelines. The style is Jan, Feb, March, April, May, June, July, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec. In tabulated lists use only the first three letters for all months, e.g. Jan, Jun, Jul. Abbreviate the names of months in text when they are used with a specific date, e.g. Jun. 19, Dec. 25.

Similarly, in Germany a collapse known as Bankrott is more serious than a normal liquidation.In the United States, a company or individual is designated bankrupt when a court enters an order for relief in either a Chapter 11 reorganisation or Chapter 7 liquidation case. They may become bankrupt by virtue of a voluntary filing on their own behalf, or an involuntary filing by a required number of creditors.

The U.S. Geological Survey favours magnitude, more exactly known as the "moment magnitude", which gives readings consistent with the Richter scale. Magnitude is not an automatic guide to likely damage. This depends on other factors such as the depth of the quake below the earth's surface. The strongest quake ever measured was 9.5 magnitude in Chile in May, 1960, while there are more than 1 million minor tremors of between 2 and 2.9 magnitude every year. Besides Richter, there are other ways to measure earthquakes including the Mercalli scale or the Japanese Shindo scale.

Check that the units of measurement are not out by a factor of 10, or a 100, or a 1,000. Try to appreciate the underlying logic of the numbers rather than accepting them at face value. Ask yourself if the numbers are feasible and realistic. Remember that a journalist plus a calculator often equals mistake.Spell out the digits one to nine in text except for dates and times, when figures should always be used, e.g. The four foreign ministers will meet at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) on March 3. The same applies to ordinal numbers: first, second, third etc up to ninth, then 10th 100th 144th etc. Use numerals in ages, 4-year-old, and before millions and billions, 2 million, 5 billion.

Place repeated figures in brackets to remove any doubt. Write ... raised bank rate to 6.5 percent (repeat 6.5 percent).Figures in brackets are generally used only for comparisons.

As a rule round off millions to the nearest 10,000, thousands to the nearest 100, hundreds to the nearest 10.Figures are normally rounded to two significant decimals, with halves rounded upwards. Thus15.564 becomes 15.56, while 15.565 becomes 15.57.Do not round interest rates. Give them to the full number of decimal places as given by the source of the information.Round foreign exchange quotations to four decimal places, e.g. the dollar rose to 0.9784 euros. If a country adjusts its currency, any rate given must not be rounded off, e.g. Manchukistan announced a rate of 5.79831 thaler to the dollar.Do not round company dividends, e.g. the company announced a dividend of 0.123456 pence per share.Where totals do not add up because of rounding, this should be explained.When reporting decimalised figures always use a full stop, e.g. 42.5. Do not follow the practice in continental Europe of using a comma instead of a decimal point. When reporting thousands, use a comma, not a full stop, e.g. 10,000.When reporting a range of figures use the style 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion not 1.2-1.4 billion or between 400 and 500 miles not between 400-500 miles.Always spell out billion, except in headlines when it can be abbreviated to bln. Use decimals before million and billion. Write 2.5 million not two and a half million.Twice not two time or two times.

Otherwise do not hyphenate, e.g. housekeeper.Where a verb and adverb are paired to form a noun, hyphenate if the verb ends and the adverb begins with a vowel, e.g. cave-in, flare-up.Hyphenate titles when the first word is a preposition, e.g. under-secretary, vice-admiral, or when a noun is followed by an adjective, e.g. attorney-general.

Do not hyphenate when the noun follows the adjective,e.g. second lieutenant.Hyphenate fractions, e.g. three-quarter, two-thirds.Hyphenate secondary compass points, e.g. south-southwest but not main ones e.g. southwest.Hyphenate compound words when not to do so would result in an ugly sound or confusion of meaning, e.g. cross-section, sea-eagle.Hyphenate both terms in phrases such as short- and medium-range missiles.

We need the exact name of the borrower, whether the loan is being guaranteed by a parent company or another body, the amount, the maturity and the interest rate. If the interest rate is variable or floating , then we need the specific reference or base rate of interest, e.g. the three-month or six-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), and the margin of interest paid above, or even below it, e.g. 1/4 percentage point.Abbreviations such as Libor, Sibor, etc., are acceptable on second reference or in headlines. The interest payment might vary with the maturity. A five-year loan could pay 1/8 over Libor for three years, rising to 1/4 over Libor for the last two years. The loan might have a grace period the period during which only interest and no principal is paid.We should also report the fees paid to the banks, to discover the true cost to the borrower. For loans, there is likely to be a commitment fee payment on any unused funds and a facility fee, which is a payment for arranging the loan.Before a loan is fully repaid, borrowers can change the terms or replace it altogether. Sometimes a financially healthy borrower will take advantage of an improving market or credit rating to do so; but often requests for changed terms are signs of financial desperation. Of the definitions below, for example, a refinancing or refinancing in itself does not indicate financial health or desperation. More details would be required. The other terms, however, signal trouble.The borrower may also be in breach of certain agreements concerning its overall financial health. In either case, an event of default may then have occurred, but the lender can refrain from calling a default, preferring to help the borrower sort things out.

Do not alter anything put in quotation marks other than to delete words, and then only if the deletion does not alter the sense of the quote. Quotes personalise stories and give them immediacy. Try to inject a quote into the first three paragraphs of any story where it is appropriate.Before starting a quote, use a colon. He said: "I don't think so", not He said, "I don't think so". Delete routine obscenities.Show deletions from a quoted text with three full stops with a space before and after, e.g. He said: We will win by fair means or foul ... and the devil take the hindmost.If the words omitted are at the end of a sentence and are followed by another sentence in quotation marks, then the next word is capitalised to show the start of a new sentence. We will fight and we will win ... We will never surrender. You may drop words in this way only if the deletion does not alter the sense of the quote.To background or explain a quote, do so in a separate paragraph or by bracketing a phrase into the quoted remarks, e.g. He said: They (the Khmer Rouge) are bound to fail.When quoting the same source for a lengthy statement there is no need to repeat the source paragraph by paragraph as long as there is no doubt who is speaking.Do not run one person s quote into another s. Use a bridging sentence or phrase to make the transition from one source to the next clear to the reader e.g. The world is round, said Smith, but Jones disagreed: It is round, Jones said.Avoid quotes in colloquial or parochial language not easily translated or understood in other countries. If you do give such quotes, explain what they mean, e.g. He said: Clinton is behind the eight ball (in a difficult situation).In a quote spell out what is actually spoken rather than using customary style abbreviations. It is better to write The president does not think that Doctor Williams needs to resign, he said, rather than The president does not think that Dr Williams needs to resign, he said.When translating quotes from another language into English, do so in an idiomatic way rather than with pedantic literalness. However, give a literal translation if a statement is tendentious and likely to be the subject of close analysis.Avoid excessive use of direct quotes in English when a speaker has spoken in another language.The full stop goes inside the quotation marks when the quotation is a complete sentence. "The president told us 'I will not raise your taxes.' But he did". It goes outside the quotation marks when the quotation is the final part of the sentence. "The president told us 'I will not raise your taxes',"When the quotation precedes the source put the comma inside the quotation marks. We have no choice but to increase taxes, the president said.Quote the titles of films, plays and books but not of ships, aircraft, newspapers or magazines.`},{word_reuters:"raccoon",meaning_reuters:""},{word_reuters:"race",meaning_reuters:`Reuters stories should be free of conscious or unconscious racism. Avoid racial stereotyping and describe membership of a group, ethnicity or race precisely. For further guidance, go to the sections on value judgments and religious, cultural and national differences under Specialised Guidance.Mention race or ethnicity only when relevant to the understanding of a story. For example, if someone is facing deportation, it is appropriate to give his or her nationality. Similarly, the ethnic origin of a person who receives racial threats or is the target of a racist attack is essential context.Take care when reporting crimes and court cases. The race of an accused person is not usually relevant.Clearly, race is an important factor in stories about racial controversy or immigration, or where an issue cuts across racial lines. For example, if European-born people join Tibetan exiles in demonstrations against China's Tibet policy, this is a point worth mentioning.Race is pertinent in reporting a feat or appointment unusual for a person of a particular ethnic group, for example someone born in China who becomes an international cricket umpire. In the United States, the terms black and African-American are both acceptable. Black is fine as an adjective, eg "Obama will be the first black U.S. president". As a noun, the plural is acceptable where it might contrast with another group, eg doctors found differences between the treatment offered to whites and blacks. Do not use black as a singular noun -- it is both awkward and offensive. "Barack Obama would be the first black to become U.S. president" is unacceptable. Better to say "Barack Obama will become the first black U.S. president". Native Spanish speakers in the United States may be referred to as Latino or Hispanic, but it is better to be specific (Colombian, Mexican). Also, some people from Latin America are not Hispanic, eg Brazilians. As a general rule, use the term by which the people of a particular ethnic group describe themselves: Inuit (not Eskimo), Roma (not Gypsy), Sami (not Lapp), Native American (not Indian).Capitalise the names of races and peoples: Asian, Jew, Hispanic.

Fowler hold good:Prefer the familiar word to the far-fetched.Prefer the short word to the long and the single word to the circumlocution.Prefer the concrete word to the abstract.Prefer the Saxon word to the Romance.Avoid pompous words like ongoing, escalating, prestigious, meaningful, facility. More often than not we can also do without special, key, dramatic, major, giant, large-scale, massive and crisis. Modish words like confrontation substitute polysyllabic vagueness for the crisp precision of (in this case) clash, dispute or even war.News stories relying heavily on phrases that have become stale through over use are like paintings done by number. They convey information but lack life or freshness. Avoid clich\xC3\xA9s that exaggerate or over-simplify e.g. the postage-stamp country, the oil-rich sheikhdom.In diplomacy and politics: face-to-face talks, on key issues, top-level meeting, headed into talks on, spearheaded a major initiative, rubber-stamp parliament, lashed out, landmark agreement.In disasters: mercy mission, airlifted/rushed to hospital, giant C-130 transports, massive aid, an air and sea search was under way, disaster probe, sifted through the wreckage.Of violence: lone gunman, strife-torn province, embattled city, baton-wielding police,stone-throwing demonstrators, steel-helmeted troops braced themselves for, police swoop, pre-dawn raid, staged an attack on, (tautologically) anti-government rebels, (tautologically) armed soldiers. Avoid armed police unless writing about a country where the police are normally unarmed. Then explain.Of industrial trouble: top union leaders, bosses, in a bid to settle, hammer out an agreement.Euphemism, beloved of bureaucrats and social scientists, seeks to cloak reality, sometimes unpleasant, in innocuous words. Shun it. Except in quotation, write elderly people not senior citizens; kill not terminate with extreme prejudice; poor not disadvantaged, died of cancer not passed away after a fight with cancer.Technical and professional jargon has no place on the Reuters file unless you are writing for a narrow, specialist audience and are certain that your story is not likely to interest a broader readership. Backwardation might have a place without explanation in a report written uniquely for the gold market on a dull trading day, but if gold hits a high in a time of crisis your story should explain it or convey the meaning in simple terms without using the word itself.Similarly, stories should not contain jargon associated with a specific profession, least of all our owne.g. do not use stringer in a story about a journalist. Use freelance journalist. Think carefully before using quotes laced with jargon. Paraphrase instead.Journalese stems from importing into the text language used as shorthand in headlines. Some examples to avoid: Aimed at ... amid reports that... burgeoning (growing)... cutback (cut) ... dubbed (called)... due to (when what you mean is because of)... economic/fiscal woes ... embattled... giant (large) ... global (unless we mean literally that)... hit by fears that... lash out.. long-time foe... looks set to... major (big, large) ... massive (big) ... meaningful (real, significant) ... modalities (means, procedures) ... mum (silent)... OKs (approves) ... oil-rich... parameters (limits)... probe (inquiry) ... reportedly.. rocked by .. the statement came as... war-torn.Avoid unnecessarily long words and clumsy strings of names and titles. Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is fine. Under-Secretary for Military Procurement Major-General Abdul Karim al-Razzak is not. Split up such names and titles; either the Under-Secretary for Military Procurement,Major-General Abdul Karim al-Razzak, or Major-General Abdul Karim al-Razzak, under-secretary for military procurement. Here are some long words commonly and unnecessarily used when there is an acceptable shorter and simpler version:additional - morealternative - otherapproximately - aboutattempt - tryconfrontation - clash, disputeconstruct - buildcutback - cutdemonstrate - showdispatch - senddiscover - findescalation - rise, increaseestablish - set upextinguish - put outfacility - plant, base etc.finalise - complete, finishfollowing - afterlarge-scale - bigmanufacture - makemodalities - meansnegotiations - talksnumerous - manyparticipate - take partpermit - letrequirements - needssufficient - enoughtarget (verb) - aim attransportation - transportA fresh and vivid metaphor can add much to a story. But avoid mixed metaphors, e.g. The Egyptian swimmers walked away with the championships, and metaphors whose literal sense is absurd e.g., a growing bottleneck, which would solve rather than aggravate a problem.Avoid excessive repetition of words and of stereotyped descriptions of people or things, but do not overdo the search for variations. If you are writing about Myanmar call it Myanmar and not the Southeast Asian country. It is better to repeat the United Nations than to avoid repetition by calling it the world body. It is better to repeat the word base than call it a facility.Do not retain the present indicative in reported speech. Change is to was; are to were; will and shall to would; has and have to had. Thus it is: He said it was ... not he said it is ...In news agency style, there is an exception in lead paragraphs that have the source at the end instead of the beginning of a sentence, where to avoid the present indicative would lead to lack of clarity or smack of pedantry. For example, it is acceptable to write in a lead paragraph: Giant Oil Corp will order three supertankers from the Pusan shipyard in Korea next month, the company said. If the source were at the beginning, we would write: Giant Oil Corp said it would order three supertankers from the Pusan shipyard ...Spin can be insidious and subliminal, conveyed in words and phrases that trip off the tongue or flow easily onto the page but disguise an agenda. Operation Iraqi Freedom was the name the United States gave to the military campaign in 2003 that it said was designed to liberate Iraq. We wrote that the United States invaded Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.Verbs bring action and life to a story but the wrong verb can indicate bias on our part. The verb to say is usually the best, neutral choice in reporting a speech or statement.Alleged, claimed or maintained could imply that Reuters does not believe a statement and noted, pointed out, recalled or emphasised suggest that we do. Use announced with care. Only competent authorities have the right to make announcements.Avoid concede, which implies an admission of guilt or previous error. Prefer said. Do not write refute (which means disprove) when you mean deny or reject.Other potentially partisan verbs to avoid include admitted, asserted, affirmed, contended, stressed, suggested.Come, leave and give are verbs too often misused in flabby phrases. Go for positive construction. Avoid limp phrases like The demands came when... The fire left six people dead... or The strike left commuters angry... Demands do not come; people make them. Fires do not leave people dead, they kill them. Strikes anger commuters, not leave them angry.Also avoid continued (or worse, ongoing), especially in the lead paragraph. The word gives the impression of monotonous action.

Dates: We use the day of the week. If the event took place more than a week ago, use the month and day. If it took place a year ago or more, add the year. But when a specific date is irrelevant, as with many stock images, consider dropping it altogether or just giving the year or writing something like \u201Clast month\u201D or \u201Cin April.\u201D Also, put a comma after the year if the date doesn\u2019t come at the end of the sentence. (Wrong: On June 6, 1972 a star was born. Right: On June 6, 1972, a star was born.)

Locations: This datelines entry in the AP Stylebook has a list of cities that stand alone. Any city not on this list should include either its state (abbreviated) or country. Use standard state abbreviations from the AP Stylebook, not the two-letter postal codes, unless in a complete address. Eight states are never abbreviated except in full addresses: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas, Utah. A state, state abbreviation or country should be followed by a comma when not at the end of the sentence.

Directionals: Generally speaking, identify people from left to right, putting directionals in parentheses: Mary Bean (left) and Joan Jones. If there are more than two subjects, or if the subjects are sitting at a table or are in an odd grouping, start from the left and list them clockwise: Joe Smith (from left), John Jones and Amy Jackson. But give our readers some credit. If Martha Green is in the photo with Harrison Ford, assume our readers can figure out who is who. Use directionals only if they\u2019re really necessary to identify someone.

Length: You do not need to summarize the entire story in the caption. If the caption is as deep as the photo, it\u2019s too long! Keep captions to a couple of lines.

Repetition: Assume the reader looks at a page from top to bottom. You do not need to include everything in every caption. If the top photo says Amy Morgan delivers the commencement address at Barnard College in New York City on Monday, and there is a second photo from the event, you do not need to repeat that it was at Barnard College in New York City on Monday. Once someone has been identified with a full name in the first image featuring him or her, just use a surname for later photos, unless confusion may result.

File (or undated) photo: DON\u2019T USE. It\u2019s jargon and useless, especially for the majority of stock images. Add a date to the caption if it\u2019s relevant for context.

Credits: Should be initial caps only. Sometimes they are imported in all caps; please keep an eye out and fix as needed. Also, credit style is AP, not The Associated Press. Don\u2019t put the same information in both the Photographer and Source fields. (Wrong: Photographer: Jeff Brady Source: Jeff Brady/NPR. Just use the Source field: Jeff Brady/NPR.) See photo credits

Handout photos: Credit the provider in the photo credit by placing the information in the Source field, not as part of the caption. Wrong: This handout photo from the Montana governor\u2019s office shows Jeffrey March, who was arrested Thursday following a manhunt. Right: Montana governor\u2019s office via AP (in the Source field)

Stock photos: When using a static image such as a federal building, it\u2019s generally not necessary to identify the building in the caption language. Instead, write a caption that uses facts from the story. Wrong: The Internal Revenue Service headquarters in Washington, D.C., on March 23, 2015.

Many commercial classical releases do not have album and track titles per se, apart from the names of the main compositions on the recording. Those that do spell out the compositions and their movements can vary in approach, and the liner notes and digital listings are not always trustworthy. Capitalization within titles can vary tremendously by country of origin.

The safest way to get a classical title right is to check it with a pro; NPR Music\u2019s Tom Huizenga and Anastasia Tsioulcas are NPR\u2019s current in-house experts. Here are some guidelines:

For compositions, the general rule is to style \u201Cgeneric\u201D names \u2014 those that simply describe composition types, key signatures or featured instruments \u2014 in Roman text: for example, John Adams\u2019 Violin Concerto or Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 5. In the latter case, Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony is also acceptable. (Or you can be exhaustive and write the full formal title, Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67, but for such a well-known and popular work it\u2019s usually not necessary.)
Works bearing \u201Cnongeneric\u201D names \u2014 the more artful titles assigned by the composer \u2014 are styled in italics. That includes operas (La fanciulla del West by Puccini), compositions given programmatic titles (Ravel\u2019s La valse) and song cycles (Schumann\u2019s Dichterliebe).
Individual songs in a song cycle, or arias within an opera, are styled in quotation marks: \u201CSea Snatch\u201D from Samuel Barber\u2019s Hermit Songs; \u201COmbra mai fu\u201D from Handel\u2019s Xerxes. Note that in the case of opera arias, generally only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized, e.g., \u201CThis journey to Christ\u201D from Jake Heggie\u2019s Dead Man Walking.
Certain compositions have popular nicknames \u2014 such as Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 3, \u201CEroica,\u201D or Haydn\u2019s Symphony No. 94, \u201CSurprise\u201D \u2014 which are styled in quotation marks.
When titles include key signatures, the sharp and flat keys are hyphenated: Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, \u201CMoonlight\u201D; Chopin\u2019s Berceuse in D-flat major.

Percentages take a singular verb when standing alone or when a singular word follows an of construction: The teacher said 60% was a failing grade. He said 50% of the membership was there.

For amounts less than 1% percent, precede the decimal with a zero: The cost of living rose 0.6%. Exception: baseball batting averages (Anthony Rendon is hitting .393.)

Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that apostrophes don\u2019t matter and we would be better off without them. Consider these four phrases, each of which means something different:
my sister\u2019s friend\u2019s books (refers to one sister and her friend).
my sister\u2019s friends\u2019 books (one sister with lots of friends).
my sisters\u2019 friend\u2019s books (more than one sister, and their friend).
my sisters\u2019 friends\u2019 books (more than one sister, and their friends).

The possessive in words and names ending in S normally takes an apostrophe followed by a second S (Jones\u2019s, James\u2019s), but be guided by pronunciation and use the plural apostrophe where it helps: Mephistopheles\u2019, Waters\u2019, Hedges\u2019 rather than Mephistopheles\u2019s, Waters\u2019s, Hedges\u2019s.

Plural nouns that do not end in S take an apostrophe and S in the possessive: children\u2019s games, old folk\u2019s home, people\u2019s republic, etc.

Phrases such as butcher\u2019s knife, collector\u2019s item, cow\u2019s milk, goat\u2019s cheese, pig\u2019s blood, hangman\u2019s noose, writer\u2019s cramp, etc are treated as singular.

Use apostrophes in phrases such as two days\u2019 time, 12 years\u2019 imprisonment and six weeks\u2019 holiday, where the time period (two days) modifies a noun (time), but not in nine months pregnant or three weeks old, where the time period is adverbial (modifying an adjective such as pregnant or old) \u2013 if in doubt, test with a singular such as one day\u2019s time, one month pregnant.

Proper names that contain an apostrophe stay the same in the possessive: McDonald\u2019s burgers may be delicious but Sainsbury\u2019s are just as good.

Some shops use an apostrophe, wrongly, to indicate a plural (\u201Cpea\u2019s\u201D), but will generally omit the apostrophe when one is actually required (\u201Cnew seasons asparagus\u201D), a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the greengrocer\u2019s (or grocer\u2019s) apostrophe.

Arabic usually refers to the language and literature: \u201Cthe Arabic press\u201D means newspapers written in Arabic, while \u201Cthe Arab press\u201D would include newspapers produced by Arabs in other languages.

There is no simple definition of an Arab. At an international level, the 22 members of the Arab League can safely be described as Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. At a human level, there are substantial groups within those countries \u2013 the Berbers of north Africa and the Kurds, for example \u2013 who do not regard themselves as Arabs.`},{word_guardian:"Arabic names",meaning_guardian:`Though Arabic has only three vowels \u2013 a, i and u \u2013 it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity \u2013 which often puts a strain on all three.

Typically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as \u201CMr John\u201D or \u201CDr David\u201D). Often Arabs also have familiar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as \u201CAbu Ahmad\u201D, and a woman as \u201CUmm Ahmad\u201D, the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).

Where a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.

Note also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen.

Some guidelines (for use particularly where there is no established transliteration)`},{word_guardian:"al-",meaning_guardian:"Means \u201Cthe\u201D. In names it is not capitalised, eg Ahmad al-Saqqaf, and can be dropped after the first mention (Mr Saqqaf). For placenames we drop it altogether. Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally \u201Cthe God\u201D) is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, \u201Cal\u201D is actually \u201Caal\u201D and does not mean \u201Cthe\u201D)."},{word_guardian:"abdul, abu and bin",meaning_guardian:"These are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: abdul means \u201Cslave of \u2026 \u201C and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, \u201Cslave of the merciful one\u201D, \u201Cslave of the generous one\u201D, etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, \u201Cabd\u201D (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name. abu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf. Despite the above, some people are actually known as \u201CAbdul\u201D. This is more common among non-Arab Muslims.

Times have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate hand-illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).

A look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.

Our style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is impossible to be wholly consistent \u2013 there are almost always exceptions, so if you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the main principles:

jobs all lc, eg prime minister, US secretary of state, chief rabbi, editor of the Guardian.

titles cap up titles, but not job description, eg President Barack Obama (but the US president, Barack Obama, and Obama on subsequent mention); the Duke of Westminster (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis but the pope.

government departments in English-speaking countries
Initial capitals when full name is used, eg Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Justice (UK), Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security (US), Department of Immigration and Border Protection (Australia), Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Irish Republic), Ministry of Railways (India).Lowercase when abbreviated or paraphrased, eg justice ministry, defense department, Australia\u2019s immigration department, Canadian fisheries ministry, Indian railway ministry, etc.Lowercase for translations of government departments in non-English-speaking countries, eg French foreign ministry, Russian ministry of emergency situations, etc.

See departments of state for a full list of British ones

government agencies, public bodies, quangos initial caps, eg Crown Prosecution Service, Equality and Human Rights Commission, Heritage Lottery Fund, Parole Board, Revenue and Customs.

acts of parliament initial caps (but bills lc), eg Official Secrets Act, Child Poverty Act 2010, local government bill.

airports cap the name but lc the generic part (if necessary at all), eg Heathrow, Gatwick (no need for \u201Cairport\u201D), Liverpool John Lennon airport.

artistic and cultural names of institutions, etc, get initial caps, eg British Museum, National Gallery, Royal Albert Hall, Tate Modern. Books, films, music, works of art, etc have initial caps except a, an, and, at, for, from, in, of, on, the, to (except in initial positions or after a colon), eg There Is a Light That Never Goes Out.

bridges initial caps, eg Brooklyn Bridge, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Waterloo Bridge.

churches, hospitals and schools cap up the proper or placename, lc the rest, eg St Nicolas church, Newbury; Great Ormond Street children\u2019s hospital; Ripon grammar school, Vernon county primary school.

epochs initial caps, eg Anthropocene, Mesolithic, Palaeolithic.

geographical features lc, eg Sydney harbour, Monterey peninsula, Bondi beach, Solsbury hill (but Mount Everest).

parliamentary committees, reports and inquiries all lc, eg trade and industry select committee, royal commission on long-term care for the elderly, Jenkins report.

proposed party policies lc, but in quote marks at first mention if they could cause confusion, eg national education service, \u201Cgreen new deal\u201D etc

stadiums initial caps when it is in the name of the venue eg London Stadium, Etihad Stadium, but leave out whenever possible eg at Wembley, at Old Trafford.

universities and colleges of further and higher education caps for institution, lc for departments, eg Sheffield University department of medieval and modern history, Oregon State University, Free University of Berlin, University of Queensland school of journalism, London College of Communication.

words and phrases based on proper names that have lost connection with their origins (alsatian dog, cardigan, cheddar cheese, french windows, swiss roll, wellington boots, yorkshire pudding and many others) are lc.

Type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don\u2019t react to insulin, comprises about 90% of adult cases.

Ambrose Bierce defined grammar as \u201Ca system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet of the self-made man\u201D. He had a point. Generations of schoolchildren were taught grammar as an arbitrary set of dos and don\u2019ts laid down by people who knew, or thought they knew, best.

Nowadays, grammar might be more helpfully defined as the set of rules followed by speakers of a language: for example, why in English we say \u201CI went out\u201D and not \u201CI out went\u201D. Using correct grammar is a way to communicate effectively, not to feel superior to other people because you know what a conjunction is.

Don\u2019t feel too downhearted if you were taught grammar badly, or not at all; as the linguist Steven Pinker says: \u201CA preschooler\u2019s tacit knowledge of grammar is more sophisticated than the thickest style manual\u201D`},{word_guardian:"Grammer, Kelsey",meaning_guardian:"actor fondly remembered as Dr Frasier Crane"},{word_guardian:"grandad",meaning_guardian:"but granddaughter"},{word_guardian:"grandee",meaning_guardian:"has become a cliche applied to almost any long-serving politician (though not, so far, to John Prescott); it sounds vaguely, and inappropriately, deferential"},{word_guardian:"grandparent",meaning_guardian:`Mention this status only when relevant: leave \u201Cbattling grannies\u201D and similar examples of ageism and sexism to the tabloids; in particular we should avoid such patronising drivel as \u201CHow this 55-year-old granny came to earn $25m a year\u201D (on the front page of the paper) \u2013 just in case anyone still didn\u2019t get the message, the front of G2 said: \u201CShe\u2019s five foot two, she\u2019s a grandmother and she earns $25m a year\u201D.

try not to mix them up \u2013 \u201Cwe are headed in the right direction\u201D sounds inelegant at best"},{word_guardian:"headlines",meaning_guardian:`What makes a great, or at least memorable, headline? They can be historic (\u201CMan walks on Moon\u201D), campaigning (\u201CHe lied and lied and lied\u201D), classical (\u201CBetween Cilla and Charybdis\u201D), subtle (\u201CFlo quiets the Dons\u201D), funny (\u201CSuper Caley go ballistic \u2013 Celtic are atrocious\u201D), notorious (\u201CGotcha!\u201D), scurrilous (\u201CZip me up before you go-go\u201D), or downright absurd (\u201CFreddie Starr ate my hamster\u201D). There is no magic formula but here are a few guidelines.

Use active verbs where possible, particularly in news headlines: \u201CEditor updates style guidelines\u201D is much better than \u201CStyle guidelines updated\u201D.

Avoid tabloid cliches such as bid, brand, dub and slam, and their broadsheet counterparts such as insist, signal and target. Imagining that you are describing an event, in words, to real people, is a good antidote to journalese: no one in a pub says \u201CDid you see that Brown slammed Blair in a dramatic power bid?\u201D

Just as we would in copy, we need to take care with words such as debacle, farce and fiasco, especially when combined, which we contrived to do in the headline \u201CHips fiasco descends into farce\u201D\u2013 the fact that \u201CHips farce descends into fiasco\u201D would work just as well tells you something is probably wrong here.

Strive to be fresh: tired plays on the phrase \u201CMind the gap\u201D, heard only occasionally these days by passengers on the London underground, have become tedious, as well as either baffling or infuriating to readers who do not happen to live in the capital.

Take care over ambiguity: \u201CLandmine claims dog UK arms firm\u201D, which appeared in the paper, contains so many successive nouns, some of which may or may not be verbs, that you have to read it several times to work out what it means.

Exclamation marks \u2013 look, I\u2019ve written something funny! \u2013 should never be used. Question marks are also to be avoided, as are quotation marks, unless essential to signify a quote or for legal reasons. And we should resist the temptation to save space by replacing \u201Cand\u201D with a comma: \u201CBlair and Brown agree euro deal\u201D not \u201CBlair, Brown agree euro deal\u201D.

Puns are fine \u2013 \u201CWhere there\u2019s muck there\u2019s bras\u201D, about a farmer\u2019s wife who started a lingerie business from a barn, was voted headline of the year by our staff \u2013 but do not overuse, or resort to tired puns such as \u201Cflushed with success\u201D (this story has got a plumber in it). It is possible to try just a little too hard (\u201CTo baldly grow where no mane\u2019s grown before\u201D). In the 1970s and 80s the Guardian suffered from a reputation for excruciating puns; today, we want to be known for clever, original and witty headlines.

Unexpected twists, or subtle plays on words and phrases, show the subeditor\u2019s craft at its best: a power failure in a theatre became, in the Guardian, \u201CBad lights stop play\u201D. A light touch can work beautifully: \u201CDrop dead, gorgeous\u201D, on a story about office jealousy, added one comma to a well-known film title to create the perfect headline. When Tate Modern exhibited a giant sun, to create its own indoor climate, the beautiful headline written by the Guardian\u2019s Steve Chamberlain \u2013 \u201CBut is it weather?\u201D (a rare example of a question mark being required) \u2013 deserved to be framed and exhibited in a gallery in its own right.

Be careful when making references to popular culture: \u201CMrs Culpepper\u2019s lonely hearts club banned\u201D works, because most people are familiar with the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper album, but allusions to your favourite obscure prog-rock LP are likely to pass over most readers\u2019 heads. Long after most people had forgotten the 1960s movie Charlie Bubbles, tabloid sports subeditors continued to mystify their readers by using the headline \u201CCharlie bubbles\u201D whenever anyone called Charlie scored a goal. \u201CBook lack in Ongar\u201D, about a shortage of resources in Essex libraries, remains one of the all-time great headlines, but it only works if you get the reference to John Osborne\u2019s 1956 play Look Back in Anger (or at least it did until Oasis helpfully recorded a song called Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger).

It\u2019s time for some formulaic headlines to be given a decent burial, or at least a long rest. \u201CThe kids are alright\u201D (based on a song by the Who, and subsequently a film) crops up, with minor variations, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in British newspapers: \u201CThe kids are alright online\u201D, \u201CThe kids are all right (and left)\u201D, \u201CThe kids are all right, left and centre\u201D, and so on.

Even more ubiquitous are \u201CSize isn\u2019t everything\u201D and its close relative \u201CSize doesn\u2019t matter\u201D, used to refer to a car (in two different newspapers), school uniforms, the actor Simon Callow\u2019s height, a hotel in Turkey, new houses, national economies, motorbikes, a footballer, the gallery following a golf tournament, and \u2013 once \u2013 penis size.

The ever-popular \u201CBrighton rocks\u201D and its variations are an allusion, still common, to the Graham Greene novel and subsequent film, both more than 50 years old. How many people still understand the reference? \u201CSo lucky, lucky, lucky\u201D, a recent headline we used above a photograph of Kylie Minogue, quoted lyrics from a hit she had in nearly 20 years ago. How many of our readers would be aware of this? You have to use your judgment.

If you are quoting, be sure to get it right. \u201CTalkin\u2019 about their generation\u201D, from a classic 1960s song by the Who, fails as a headline because it literally lacks rhythm (it should be \u201CTalkin\u2019 \u2018bout\u201D). We claimed that Millwall fans sing \u201CNo one likes us and we don\u2019t care\u201D; they don\u2019t sing that, and the mistake made it look as if we don\u2019t care.

As always, use common sense: in a story where two people have the same name (eg a court case about a husband and wife or brothers), it may be necessary to use Mr and Mrs or Ms, or forenames. In news stories particularly we should use an honorific if it sounds jarring or insensitive not to do so \u2013 for example, a woman whose son has been killed on active duty in Iraq should be \u201CMrs Smith\u201D and not \u201CSmith\u201D. We need to use our judgment and be guided by the tone of the piece.

Follow traditional Guardian style in leading articles (but not other comment pieces and columns on leader pages): use honorifics after first mention, unless writing about an artist, author, journalist, musician, sportsperson, criminal or dead person; use Ms for women on second mention unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs.

So: at first mention David Cameron, Harriet Harman, Sir Richard Branson, Lady Warsi, Prof John Wells, Dr Bill Bailey, the Rev George Herbert; thereafter Mr Cameron, Ms Harman, Sir Richard, Lady Warsi, Prof Wells, Dr Bailey, Mr Herbert, etc.

Hyphens tend to clutter up text (particularly when the computer breaks already hyphenated words at the end of lines). This is a widespread trend in the language: \u201CThe transition from space to hyphen to close juxtaposition reflects the progressive institutionalisation of the compound,\u201D as Rodney Huddleston puts it, in his inimitable pithy style, in his Introduction to the Grammar of English.

Inventions, ideas and new concepts often begin life as two words, then become hyphenated, before finally becoming accepted as one word. Why wait? \u201CWire-less\u201D and \u201Cdown-stairs\u201D were once hyphenated, and some old-fashioned souls still hyphenate e-mail.

Words such as chatroom, frontbench, gameplan, housebuyer and standup are all one word in our publications, as are thinktank (not a tank that thinks), longlist (not necessarily a long list) and shortlist (which need not be short).

There is no need to use hyphens with most compound adjectives, where the meaning is clear and unambiguous without: civil rights movement, financial services sector, work inspection powers, etc. Hyphens should, however, be used to form short compound adjectives, eg two-tonne vessel, three-year deal, 19th-century artist. Also use hyphens where not using one would be ambiguous, eg to distinguish \u201Cblack-cab drivers come under attack\u201D from \u201Cblack cab-drivers come under attack\u201D. A missing hyphen in a review of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters led us to refer to \u201Cthe servant abusing Natasha\u201D, rather than \u201Cthe servant-abusing Natasha\u201D.

Do not use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly, eg a hotly disputed penalty, a constantly evolving newspaper, genetically modified food, etc, but hyphens are needed with short and common adverbs, eg ever-forgiving family, much-loved character, well-established principle of style (note, however, that in the construction \u201Cthe principles of style are well established\u201D there is no need to hyphenate).
-
When an adverb can also be an adjective (eg hard), the hyphen is required to avoid ambiguity \u2013 it\u2019s not a hard, pressed person, but a hard-pressed one; an ill-prepared report, rather than an ill, prepared one.

Use a hyphen in verbs where necessary to stop this kind of thing happening:

Motorists
told: don\u2019t
panic buy
petrol

(While not panicking may well have been advisable, they had actually been told not to panic-buy.)

Prefixes such as macro, mega, micro, mini, multi, over, super and under rarely need hyphens: examples are listed separately.

As understanding of the two systems is a matter of generations, conversions (in brackets) to imperial units should be provided wherever this seems useful, though usually one conversion \u2013 the first \u2013 will suffice. Imperial units in quoted matter should be retained, and converted to metric [in square brackets] if it doesn\u2019t ruin the flow of the quote.

It is not necessary to convert moderate distances between metres and yards, which are close enough for rough and ready purposes (though it is preferable to use metres), or small domestic quantities: two litres of wine, a kilogram of sugar, a couple of pounds of apples, a few inches of string.

Small units should be converted when precision is required: 44mm (1.7in) of rain fell in two hours. But be sensible: don\u2019t convert a metric estimate into a precise imperial figure (round the conversion up or down). Tons and tonnes are close enough for most purposes to do without conversion; use tonnes (except in shipping tonnage).

Body weights and heights should always be converted in brackets: metres to feet and inches, kilograms to stones/pounds. Geographical heights and depths, of people, buildings, monuments, etc, should be converted, metres to feet. In square measurement, land is given in sq metres, hectares and sq km, with sq yards, acres or sq miles in brackets where there is space to provide a conversion. The floor areas of buildings are conventionally expressed in sq metres (or sq ft). Take great care in conversions of square and cubic measures: 2 metres is about 6.5ft, but 2 sq metres is about 21.5 sq ft

10mm

It\u2019s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed?

That\u2019s quite apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part of another, bigger number.

Never invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences together (\u201Cthe six men were jailed for a total of 87 years\u201D) is meaningless as well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 150 football pitches, or is \u201Ceight times the size of Wales\u201D, is cliched and may not be helpful.

Be wary of using different ways of reporting comparable figures within a story. It is easier for readers to compare 6% and 10% than to compare 6% and one in 10.

Here is an easy three-point guide to sidestepping common \u201Cmythematics\u201D traps:

1 Be careful in conversions, don\u2019t muddle metric and imperial, or linear, square and cubic measures. Square miles and miles square are constantly confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 square miles.

2 Be extremely wary of (or don\u2019t bother) converting changes in temperature; you run the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C corresponds to a change of about 4F.

3 When calculating percentages, beware the \u201Crose by/fell by X%\u201D construction: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase`},{word_guardian:"Nuremberg",meaning_guardian:""},{word_guardian:"N-word",meaning_guardian:"to be spelt out only if essential to a story (for example, when quoting someone accused of using it) and only after discussion with senior editorial staff"},{word_guardian:"OAPs, old age pensioners",meaning_guardian:"Do not use: they are pensioners or old people; do not use old or elderly to describe someone under 75 (the editors reserve the right to increase this upper limit, as appropriate)"},{word_guardian:"obbligato",meaning_guardian:"not obligato"},{word_guardian:"Obiang",meaning_guardian:"Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea since 1979; Obiang on second mention"},{word_guardian:"obliged",meaning_guardian:"not \u201Cobligated\u201D"},{word_guardian:"O\u2019Brian, Patrick",meaning_guardian:"author of Master and Commander"},{word_guardian:"obtuse",meaning_guardian:"means \u201Cmentally slow or emotionally insensitive\u201D (Collins); often confused with abstruse (hard to understand) or obscure"},{word_guardian:"Occam\u2019s razor",meaning_guardian:"philosophical principle, attributed to the 14th-century English friar William of Ockham, that broadly means prefer the simplest explanation, adopting the one that makes the fewest assumptions and \u201Cshaving away\u201D the rest"},{word_guardian:"occupied territories",meaning_guardian:"Gaza and the West Bank"},{word_guardian:"occurred",meaning_guardian:"two Rs"},{word_guardian:"Oceania",meaning_guardian:`a preferable term to Australasia, it is sometimes divided into Near Oceania and Remote Oceania, and comprises, according to the UN:

Grammatically, we are talking not about the noun \u201Cone\u201D but the noun phrase \u201Cone in six\u201D, signifying a group of people.

For people who were not widely known before becoming peers, or who are better known by their title, use a simple title at first mention, and thereafter surname only. Examples:

Do not use Baron, Baroness etc unless there is a particular reason to do so \u2013 for example, for satirical or ironic purposes (\u201CBaron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham\u201D).

Barbara Young, a former chief executive of the Environment Agency and Care Quality Commission (first mention), Lady Young of Old Scone (second mention), thereafter Young.

If a reader reads something in direct quotation marks in the Guardian he/she is entitled to believe that the reporter can vouch directly for the accuracy of the quote.

Copying quotes out of other newspapers without any form of attribution is simply bad journalism, never mind legally risky. If, where there are no libel issues, you\u2019re going to repeat quotes, then always say where they came from. It won\u2019t be much help in a legal action, but at least the reader can evaluate the reliability of the source. A quote in the Sunday Sport may \u2013 who knows \u2013 count for less than one from the Wall Street Journal.

If we\u2019re taking quotes from the radio or television it is our general policy to include an attribution. This matters less if it is a pooled interview or news conference that happens to be covered by, say, the BBC or Sky. If the quote comes from an exclusive interview on a radio or TV programme (eg, Today, Channel 4 News or Newsnight) we should always include an attribution.

Some further guidelines:

 Take care with direct speech: our readers should be confident that words appearing in quotation marks accurately represent the actual words uttered by the speaker, although ums and ahems can be removed and bad grammar improved. If you aren\u2019t sure of the exact wording, use indirect speech.

Where a lot of material has been left out, start off a new quote with: \u201CHe added: ... \u201D, or signify this with an ellipsis.
Take particular care when extracting from printed material, for example a minister\u2019s resignation letter.

 Avoid \u201Cthat\u201D quotes, ie The prosecutors maintained that \u201Cthis was not a trial about freedom of the internet. Instead, a serious issue has been raised about the rights of the individual.\u201D There is no reason to introduce a complete direct quote of this kind with \u201Cthat\u201D. It should be The prosecutors maintained: \u201CThis was not a trial ... \u201D etc.
...
 Colons, rather than commas, should be used to introduce quotes, ie Guardian Style says: \u201CPlease use colons, not commas;\u201D not Guardian Style says, \u201CPlease use ... \u201D etc. We are writing a newspaper, not a novel.

 Think about where the attribution goes, and avoid this kind of thing:
\u201CGordon Brown is a bully and a liar. I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour,\u201D said Mrs Pratt.

\u201CThe prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it,\u201D added Andrew Rawnsley.

It\u2019s extremely annoying to get to the end of the second par and find out it is a different speaker, because it reads as a continuation of the words of Mrs Pratt.

As a general rule, and particularly with lengthy quotations, it is better to start with the attribution, so the reader does not have to engage in a series of mental double-takes trying to find out who is supposed to be saying what. It should be:

Mrs Pratt said: \u201CGordon Brown is a bully and a liar. I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour.\u201D

Andrew Rawnsley added: \u201CThe prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it.\u201D

 Avoid quoting words when it is unnecessary to do so, like this: Ben\xEDtez said he was \u201Cangry\u201D that Liverpool were being written out of the title race. Yes, maybe, quotation marks if he was \u201Cincandescent\u201D, or \u201Cspitting with rage\u201D \u2013 but it is completely unnecessary to use quotation marks for mundane words and unexceptional quotes. They are even finding their way into headlines, which looks awful.

Similarly: MPs said they had not seen any evidence that Andy Coulson \u201Cknew that phone hacking was taking place\u201D.

From the editor:

Guardian readers would rather we did give them the unvarnished truth \u2013 or our best stab at it. It seems obvious enough. But inside many journalists \u2013 this goes for desk editors as much as reporters \u2013 there is a little demon prompting us to make the story as strong and interesting as possible, if not more so. We drop a few excitable adjectives around the place. We overegg. We may even sex it up.

Strong stories are good. So are interesting stories. But straight, accurate stories are even better. Readers who stick with us over any length of time would far rather judge what we write by our own Richter scale of news judgments and values than feel that we\u2019re measuring ourselves against the competition. Every time we flam a story up we disappoint somebody \u2013 usually a reader who thought the Guardian was different.

We should be different. Of course we compete fiercely in the most competitive newspaper market in the world. Of course we want to sell as many copies as possible. We\u2019ve all experienced peer pressure to write something as strongly as possible, if not more so.

When reporting on people who work in the sex industry it is Guardian policy that they be identified as individuals first, not by the way they earn money. So for example say police are investigating the murder of three women rather than \u201Cthree sex workers\u201D.

Be careful how you refer to children working in the industry if you do not know the circumstances around how they came to be there.

Do not use \u201Csex abuse\u201D as the term \u201Csex\u201D can imply consent.

The term victim is generally used for those in an abusive situation or at risk of abuse. The term survivor is generally used for people who have experienced sexual abuse in the past. Give priority to the preferences of the person we are writing about.

Avoid using the term \u201Chistorical\u201D to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes.

In Spanish the natural stress of a word generally occurs on the second to last syllable. Words that deviate from this norm must carry a written accent mark, known as the acento ortogr\xE1fico, to indicate where the stress falls. A guide to accents follows. If in doubt do an internet search (try the word with and without an accent) and look for reputable Spanish language sites, eg big newspapers.

Surnames ending -ez take an accent over the penultimate vowel, eg Ben\xEDtez, Fern\xE1ndez, Gim\xE9nez, G\xF3mez, Gonz\xE1lez, Guti\xE9rrez, Hern\xE1ndez, Jim\xE9nez, L\xF3pez, M\xE1rquez, Mart\xEDnez, N\xFA\xF1ez, Ord\xF3\xF1ez, P\xE9rez, Qui\xF1\xF3nez, Ram\xEDrez, Rodr\xEDguez, S\xE1ez, V\xE1squez, V\xE1zquez, Vel\xE1zquez.

The word \u201Cstampede\u201D suggests a panicking mass of people who are collectively responsible for trampling others to death, whereas in fact the deaths occur (at a slower speed) as an accidental result of high densities. Those who allow such densities to build up are responsible and as a result, as with Hillsborough, they are often keen to portray the event as a panic or a stampede.

Most commonly, the subjunctive is a third person singular form of the verb expressing hypothesis, typically something demanded, proposed, imagined: he demanded that she resign at once, I propose that she be sacked, she insisted Jane sit down.

It is particularly common in American English and in formal or poetic contexts: If I were a rich man, etc, and you have to admit the song sounds better than \u201CIf I was a rich man ...\u201D

\u201CIf every election or ballot in which there are cases of bad practice was to be invalidated, democracy would soon become a laughing stock ...\u201D (leading article); \u201CIf this was the centred Conservative party that Cameron claims, its strategists wouldn\u2019t be half as worried as they are ...\u201D (column)

Nobody died and no great harm was done, but as professional writers we should be aware of the distinction. Used properly, the subjunctive can add elegance to your writing; an object lesson was provided in a Gary Younge column of 5 July 2010: \u201CIt was as though Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher were standing for leader of the opposition ... \u201C (one of three examples of the subjunctive in the piece).

Journalists should exercise particular care in reporting suicide or issues involving suicide, bearing in mind the risk of encouraging others. This applies to presentation, including the use of pictures, and to describing the method of suicide. Any substances should be referred to in general rather than specific terms. When appropriate, a helpline number (eg Samaritans) should be given. The feelings of relatives should also be carefully considered.

The following note should be added to stories about suicide:

In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.
Change the order if necessary to reflect the context and origin of the story; only the Samaritans number need be used in print editions that are not sold outside the UK.

The endnote should not be used on stories about assisted dying.

The editor\u2019s guidelines are as follows:

First, remember the reader, and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend.

Second, use such words only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article; there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes. The use of swearwords in furniture, especially headlines, should also be avoided unless an editor deems it absolutely necessary.

Third, the stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it.

Finally, never use asterisks, or such silliness as b------, which are just a cop-out, as Charlotte Bront\xEB recognised: \u201CThe practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent people are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which, however well meant, is weak and futile.

Although most terrorist acts are violent, you can be a terrorist without being overtly violent (eg poisoning a water supply or gassing people on the underground).

Does having a good cause make a difference? The UN says no: \u201CCriminal acts calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.\u201D

Whatever one\u2019s political sympathies, suicide bombers, the 9/11 attackers and most paramilitary groups can all reasonably be regarded as terrorists (or at least groups some of whose members perpetrate terrorist acts).

Nonetheless we need to be very careful about using the term: it is still a subjective judgment \u2013 one person\u2019s terrorist may be another person\u2019s freedom fighter, and there are former \u201Cterrorists\u201D holding elected office in many parts of the world. Some critics suggest that, for the Guardian, all terrorists are militants \u2013 unless their victims are British. Others may point to what they regard as \u201Cstate terrorism\u201D. Often, alternatives such as militants, radicals, separatists, etc, may be more appropriate and less controversial, but this is a difficult area: references to the \u201Cresistance\u201D, for example, imply more sympathy to a cause than calling such fighters \u201Cinsurgents\u201D. The most important thing is that, in news reporting, we are not seen \u2013 because of the language we use \u2013 to be taking sides.

Note that the phrase \u201Cwar on terror\u201D should always appear in quotes, whether used by us or (more likely) quoting someone else`},{word_guardian:"Tesco",meaning_guardian:"not Tesco\u2019s"},{word_guardian:"Tessa",meaning_guardian:"tax-exempt special savings account, replaced by Isas"},{word_guardian:"Test",meaning_guardian:"(cricket and rugby) the third Test, etc"},{word_guardian:"Tetra Pak",meaning_guardian:"TM"},{word_guardian:"Texan",meaning_guardian:"a person; the adjective isTexas: Texas Ranger, Texas oilwells, Texas tea etc"},{word_guardian:"textbook",meaning_guardian:""},{word_guardian:"Thaksin Shinawatra",meaning_guardian:"former prime minister of Thailand; Thaksin on second mention"},{word_guardian:"thalidomide",meaning_guardian:""},{word_guardian:"that",meaning_guardian:"Do not use automatically after the word \u201Csaid\u201D, but it can be useful: you tend to read a sentence such as \u201Che said nothing by way of an explanation would be forthcoming\u201D as \u201Che said nothing by way of an explanation\u201D and then realise that it does not say that at all; \u201Che said that nothing by way of an explanation would be forthcoming\u201D is much clearer. A similar problem arises with verbs such as argue and warn. \u201CHe argued the case for war had not been made\u201D and \u201Che warned the case for war had not been made\u201D both become much clearer if you insert \u201Cthat\u201D after the verb"},{word_guardian:"that or which?",meaning_guardian:`The traditional definition is that \u201Cthat\u201D defines and \u201Cwhich\u201D informs (gives extra information), as in:
\u201CThis is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is falling down.\u201D
\u201CThe Guardian, which I read every day, is the paper that I admire above all others.\u201D
\u201CI am very proud of the sunflowers that I grew from seed\u201D (some of them); \u201CI am very proud of the sunflowers, which I grew from seed\u201D (all of them).
Note that in such examples the sentence remains grammatical without \u201Cthat\u201D (\u201Cthis is the house Jack built,\u201D \u201CThe Guardian is the paper I admire above all others,\u201D \u201CI am very proud of the sunflowers I grew\u201D) but not without \u201Cwhich\u201D (\u201Cthis house, John built, is falling down\u201D).

A word about relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses (also known as defining, best thought of as giving essential information by narrowing it down) are not enclosed by commas, whereas non-restrictive relative clauses (non-defining, giving non-essential information) are.

In the three examples, \u201Cwhich John built\u201D, \u201Cwhich I read every day\u201D and \u201Cwhich I grew from seed\u201D are all non-restrictive. They give extra information, they are preceded by a comma, and they use \u201Cwhich\u201D rather than \u201Cthat\u201D. If you try them with \u201Cthat\u201D they sound odd (\u201Cthe Guardian, that I read every day\u201D). It\u2019s not the same the other way round: although \u201Cthat\u201D is more common in restrictive clauses, you can use \u201Cwhich\u201D: \u201Cthe Guardian is the paper which I read every day\u201D.

A formula that may help simplify things:
Restrictive clauses \u2013 \u201Cthat\u201D (desirable), no comma (essential).
Non-restrictive clauses \u2013 \u201Cwhich\u201D, comma (both essential).
So a BBC radio interviewer who asked the question \u201Cshould advertising, which targets children, be banned?\u201D was suggesting that all advertising targets children. She meant \u201Cshould advertising that targets children be banned?\u201D`},{word_guardian:"the",meaning_guardian:`Leaving \u201Cthe\u201D out often reads like official jargon: say the conference agreed to do something, not \u201Cconference agreed\u201D; the government has to do, not \u201Cgovernment has to\u201D; the Super League (rugby), not \u201CSuper League\u201D.

Avoid the \u201Cprime minister David Cameron\u201D syndrome: do not use constructions such as \u201Cprime minister David Cameron said\u201D. Prominent figures can just be named, with their function at second mention: \u201CDavid Cameron said last night\u201D (first mention); \u201Cthe prime minister said\u201D (subsequent mentions).

If it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write \u201CNigel Adkins, the Sheffield United manager, said\u201D or \u201Cthe Sheffield United manager, Nigel Adkins, said\u201D. In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one person in the position, so write \u201Cthe Tory prime minister, David Cameron, said\u201D (only one person in the job), but \u201Cthe former Tory prime minister John Major said\u201D (there have been many).

Ranks

Most army ranks can and should be abbreviated even at first reference - see list below. Listed separately are those abbreviations to be used only at second reference - after the rank has been spelt out in full at first mention. A third category lists those ranks that we do not abbreviate, even at second reference. But ranks should be spelt out in full (lower case) when they are used without reference to a specific name - eg: The major general attended the meeting.

Abbreviations which can be used at first reference:

If knighted, military figures would be Gen Sir Arthur Whitehead, then Gen Whitehead. If made a peer, they would just be Lord Whitehead.

General - Gen
Lieutenant General - Lt Gen (later, just Gen)
Major General - Maj Gen (later, just Gen)
Brigadier - Brig
Brigadier General - Brig Gen (later, just Gen) - this is no longer a rank in the British army

Corps

Both the US and UK armies are divided into corps - which should be capped up when you are giving a name - eg: The Royal Corps of Signals. Any preceding number should be expressed as a Roman numeral - eg: III Corps. A corps is led by a lieutenant general - written as Lt Gen at first reference when accompanied by the name. If the full title is Lt Gen Sir John Smith, then the correct form at second reference is Gen Smith.

Divisions

Army corps are divided into divisions. Capped up when you are giving a name - eg: 1st Armoured Division; lower case if the reference is non-specific - eg: Two divisions of troops will take control of the area. A division is under the command of a major general (which you would spell out only if there is no name attached - eg: A division is led by a major general. As a rank, the title is written Maj Gen, even at first reference.  

Regiments/Brigades

Divisions are commonly divided into regiments or brigades. Lower case if the reference is non-specific; capped up when you are giving a name - eg: The Household Cavalry Regiment; The Parachute Regiment; 7th Armoured Brigade; 101st Logistics Brigade. A preceding ordinal number is not expressed as a word.

Battalions

Regiments are divided into battalions. The third battalion of the Parachute Regiment is best written as 3 Para - ie contrary to our usual rule, the cardinal number is expressed as a digit, whatever it is (the form "3rd Bn" should be avoided, given that we sometimes abbreviate "billion" to "bn"). The officer commanding a battalion is a lieutenant colonel: Lt Col when accompanied by a name (Col at second reference), but spelt out when no name is attached. 

Small units

The correct terms with reference to tanks and armour are regiment/ squadron/ troop with reference to the Infantry, they are battalion/ company/ platoon/ section; and with reference of the Artillery, they are regiment/ battery/ troop/ section.  

A troop is a group of soldiers, normally about 30. Do not refer to individuals as troops - to say: "Five troops have been killed in Afghanistan" would be wrong. But you can use the term in a generic sense eg: The UK has sent more troops to Helmand province.`},{word_bbc:"art movements",meaning_bbc:"In general, these should be lower case except where it's a wider cultural movement, as in Renaissance or Romanticism; named after a person or place - Bauhaus and pre-Raphaelite; or there might be confusion with another usage, as in Arts and Crafts."},{word_bbc:"arrest/detain",meaning_bbc:'are not synonymous.

In such cases: all numbers are written as digits, and the word "seconds" need not be used throughout. Eg: X took gold with a time of 9.93 seconds. In second place was Y, on 9.94. And the bronze medal went to Z, on 9.96.Note that portions of seconds are expressed as decimals, rather than being written out as fractions.

Use the proper technical description in the top four pars (eg: Smith Scaffolding has gone into administration). Elsewhere, it is acceptable to say simply that a company has collapsed or gone bust.Outside the UK, the term bankruptcy can be valid.

They are easier to read on screen than dense paragraphs of text.

If the items in a bullet point list are complete sentences in themselves, then each should start with a capital letter, and in general end with no punctuation: eg:

There is more than one way to cook potatoes.

You can roast them in the oven
You can mash them with milk and butter
You can fry them in a pan
If the items are not complete sentences, they should start with a lower case letter, and again omit punctuation at the end: eg:

If you want to cook potatoes, you can

roast them in the oven
mash them with milk and butter
fry them in a pan
Single-word lists of nouns should also start with a lower case letter: eg:

Teachers think they are getting a raw deal in three areas:

pay
hours
pensions
The exception on punctuation is that we do include a question mark after each item if that is what logic would suggest: eg:

Is the first thing you think about in the morning

your headache?
your shower?
your breakfast?
This is also true with complete sentence lists. Eg:

There are three questions you should ask yourself each morning:

Why am I here?
Who is this person?
Where are my clothes?`},{word_bbc:"bullseye",meaning_bbc:"ie no apostrophe."},{word_bbc:"Bundestag",meaning_bbc:"ie initial cap.

A byline should be reserved for original journalism.

Picture bylines should be used sparingly: for well-known BBC correspondents writing a substantial piece for us, or occasionally for a diary or a first-person piece.

The tag in the CPS production system will enable you to provide:

a) a first line beginning By (capped) and then giving the person's name.

b) a second line giving further information

Examples:

By Zoe McGuire
BBC News, Birmingham

By Jonathan Garrod
BBC Stories

By Paula Harris
BBC News

Specialist non-correspondents should be called reporter, not "staff" or "writer" etc (initial cap, then lower case) eg:

By Kevin Robertson
Political reporter, BBC News

By Christine Peters
Health reporter, BBC News

Refer to specialist BBC correspondents and editors as follows:

By Peter Bywater 
Political editor, BBC News

By Jane McGuire 
Business editor, BBC News

By Mark Morgan
Transport correspondent, BBC News

We should refer to (non-specialist) overseas BBC correspondents as belonging to "BBC News" and give their location. So examples would be:

By Simon Hargreaves
BBC News, Beirut

By Peter James
BBC News, Washington

By Melanie Buford
BBC News, Brussels

Pieces of original journalism by non-staff should normally follow a similar pattern: ie the first line of a byline should consist of the name only eg:

By Clive James

If relevant, a job description or a location can be added as a second line eg:

By Nicola Horlick
Investment fund manager

However, it will sometimes be preferable with high-profile outside contributors to give further information not as a second line but as a more detailed standfirst, in bold eg: Nicola Horlick has run a number of successful investment funds and earned the nickname Superwoman for having a high-flying career and bringing up five children. If the expert has a rather lower profile, stick with the one-line job description at the top, and add a longer note at the end of the story. This should be written in italics (not bold).

We do not use correspondents' bylines with on-demand video and audio pages. The convention is to go with The BBC's as a label; Sport, where appropriate, say BBC Sport's.`},{word_bbc:"bypass",meaning_bbc:'ie no "e" - and no hyphen.'},{word_bbc:"cabinet",meaning_bbc:"(grouping of senior ministers) ie lower case."},{word_bbc:"Cabinet Office",meaning_bbc:"ie initial caps.

Drop the "of" - and substitute a comma.'},{word_bbc:"capitalisation",meaning_bbc:`A few titles are always capped up, whether you name the person or not (eg the Queen, the Pope, Archbishop of XX). But our style generally is to minimise the use of capital letters.

Political job titles have initial caps only when the title is next to the name, in whatever order. Thus:

The Foreign Secretary, Harold Thomas, said...

US President James Tucker

Mrs Gordon, who has been prime minister since 2015...

Any post mentioned without reference to the post-holder should be in lower case - e.g.

The prime minister will be out of the country for several days.

The same rule applies for former holders of political office (eg The former President, James Tucker, is to make a political comeback. The former president said he wanted to spend less time with his family).

Similarly, Leader of the Opposition is capped up only if accompanied by the name. Other opposition portfolios are always lower case, with or without the name (eg The shadow chancellor, Brian Banker, was furious. There was jeering when the shadow chancellor left).

Also, see \u201Cjob titles\u201D entry.

Also use lower case for all jobs outside politics, with or without a name (eg the director general of the BBC, Michael Graves, has praised the England cricket captain), except that police and military titles accompanied by the name are always capped up (eg Sgt Wilson is to receive an award for bravery). The UN secretary general is capped when with a name; the director of public prosecutions is always lower case.

Governments are not capped up (eg The Italian government has resigned).

Use initial cap Parliament with reference only to (a) Westminster in any context, and (b) the Scottish and European Parliaments where you are giving the full title. Otherwise, lower case (eg Mrs Gordon will face questions in Parliament; There is to be an emergency session of the Scottish Parliament; They say they will halt proceedings of parliament in Strasbourg).

Similarly, assembly is capped only with the full title (eg: The National Assembly for Wales is to move to a new home; The problems facing farmers will be discussed by the Welsh assembly).

In general, government schemes and initiatives are capped \u2013 Northern Powerhouse, Big Society, National Minimum Wage \u2013 while benefits are lower case, such as universal credit and personal independence payment.

For place names: use upper case for recognised regions, and for vaguer political/geographical areas (eg the Middle East, Western Europe). Otherwise, lower case (south-west France, east Lancashire). Also lower case for south Wales, north Wales, mid-Wales etc.

For Latin names of plants, animals etc, use italics and cap the first word only (eg Corvus corone).`},{word_bbc:"captions (for pictures)",meaning_bbc:'Picture captions in news stories should be no longer than two lines, or one line for large pictures. There is no full stop at the end of a caption, other than in picture galleries. A caption is usually unnecessary with a map or a generic graphic.The wording of the caption should follow the geography of the picture, from left to right (eg if Smith is on the left and Jones on the right, the caption should not say "Jones and Smith"). Use full names whenever possible.A caption should be more than a literal description of the picture; it should add value (eg: George Smith and Terry Jones: Long-time friends).For direct quotes, use a colon and double quotation marks (eg: George Smith: \u201CI\u2019m lucky to be alive\u201D). Any colon in a caption, whether or not introducing a quote, must be followed by a capital letter (eg: George Smith: A lucky man).To focus on one individual among several, use brackets rather than commas (eg: Terry Jones (centre) was among friends). If space is very short, you can abbreviate such labels to their initial letter only, capped up, ie (C) (L) or (R).'},{word_bbc:"cardiac arrest/heart attack",meaning_bbc:"These are not synonymous.

The same applies for mentally disabled people.Remember, \u201Cdisabled\u201D is a description not a group of people. \u201CThe disabled\u201D implies a homogeneous group not individuals.Disabled people do not always want to be solely identified by their disability but there is some debate about whether it is appropriate to talk about \u201Cpeople with disabilities\u201D \u2013 with critics of the phrase saying, for example, they have been disabled by society\u2019s failure to cater for them.Do not refer to someone being "wheelchair-bound" or "confined to a wheelchair", since wheelchairs provide mobility - not confinement. Instead, write about a person who uses a wheelchair or who is in a wheelchair or a wheelchair user.When referring specifically to an individual or group\u2019s medical or health condition, \u201Cimpairment\u201D is relatively neutral, while \u201Csuffers\u201D or \u201Cafflicted\u201D can have negative connotations. Many disabled people do not see their impairment in negative terms.\u201CCondition\u201D is more commonly used to describe a medical condition. Say \u201Cliving with\u201D, \u201Cwas diagnosed\u201D, or \u201Chas\u2026\u201D.\u201CInvalid\u201D, \u201Chandicapped\u201D, \u201Ccripple\u201D and \u201Cdeformed\u201D should not be used, nor \u201Cmentally handicapped\u201D, \u201Cmentally defective\u201D, \u201Cretarded\u201D or \u201Csubnormal.\u201D Consider instead \u201Ca person who has a learning disability\u201D.Avoid describing people as "mute". "Unable to speak" is a suitable alternative."Spastic" is a term that is not acceptable. Speak of people with cerebral palsy. "Handicap" and "cripple" are also not acceptable.We do not speak of "epileptics" or "epilepsy sufferers". Instead, say people with epilepsy. The use of the term "fit" for an epileptic incident is increasingly seen as outdated and can be offensive. The preferred word is seizure, though attack can also be acceptable. However, if a speaker uses fit in a direct quote that's OK.Avoid using the word "leper" when describing someone with leprosy. It carries very negative connotations, suggesting an outcast or pariah. There will inevitably be occasions when someone says he/she was "treated like a leper". This is acceptable provided it is in direct quotes.In reporting stories about albinism, we should recognise that it might not be a familiar term to everyone. People with albinism or albino people would be our preference, with "albinos" only to be used in headlines.Rather than \u201Cdwarf\u201D or \u201Cdwarves\u201D, the preferred terms are usually \u201Crestricted growth\u201D or the medical term \u201Cdwarfism\u201D if used in the right context - for example, \u201Csomeone who has dwarfism\u201D or \u201Csomeone who has a form of dwarfism\u201D.Avoid using the terms \u201Cbattle\u201D and \u201Cfight\u201D when referring to someone seeking to overcome an illness or disease such as cancer, unless they themselves use it.See also mental health`},{word_bbc:"disc/disk",meaning_bbc:"CDs and DVDs are discs, and someone may suffer a slipped disc; but for the computer storage devices we use a disk (eg hard disk, floppy disk)."},{word_bbc:"discharge",meaning_bbc:'People are not "released" from hospital - they are discharged (or sent home, allowed home etc).'},{word_bbc:"disclose",meaning_bbc:"Use with care.

Sometimes, logic will dictate that metric should come first (eg: Train speeds on the British side of the Channel Tunnel compare badly with French top speeds of 300km/h (186.4mph).The words "metre", "kilometre" etc are not written out in full, even at first reference; use the abbreviations m, km, etc - with no space and no "s" in the plural.'},{word_bbc:"DA notice",meaning_bbc:"Defence Advisory Notice (formerly D notice) - an official request to withhold a news item for reasons of national security."},{word_bbc:"Doctor",meaning_bbc:"Use the title Dr (always abbreviated) for doctors of medicine, scientific doctors and church ministers who hold doctorates - but only when it is relevant.

Sexuality, race, ethnicity or disability should not be mentioned unless they are relevant to the subject matter. But when we do focus on one aspect of a person's character we should ensure we do not define them by it. Where possible, use the term/s and pronoun/s preferred by people themselves, when they have made their preferences clear.Gay/lesbian: Use gay as an adjective rather than a noun (eg: two gay men - but not "two gays"). It can apply to members of both sexes, but current preferred practice is to refer to "gay men and lesbians".For wider references, talk about LGBT people or the LGBT community (lesbian, gay bisexual, transgender). If this does not suffice, the preferred initialism is \u201CLGBTQ\u201Dor\u201CLGBTQ+\u201D - the \u201CQ\u201D means questioning and/or queer, the \u201C+\u201Dacknowledges not all people may feel represented by these initials.Where possible, however, initials should be avoided. The issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people can be very different and the more specific we can be with our language, the better.If using LGBT+ or another formulation - for example in a quote \u2013 consider the likely audience of the story and whether the term needs explaining.  Instead of \u201CLGB\u201D, for example, consider \u201Clesbian, gay or bisexual\u201D.  Homosexual means people of either sex who are attracted to people of their own gender, but take care how you use it. While it can be fine in historical, judicial or legislative references, it can be considered offensive in other contexts because of past associations with illegal behaviour and mental illness.Bisexual is an adjective to describe someone who is romantically and/or sexually attracted to more than one gender.\u201CGender identity\u201D has come to mean how people feel or present themselves, distinct from their biological sex or sexual orientation. Use sex to refer to a person\u2019s physical development and gender to describe how they identify themselves.Transgender, or trans, is a good umbrella term for a person whose gender identity differs from their sex at birth. A person born male who lives as a female, would typically be described as a \u201Ctransgender woman\u201D and would take the pronoun \u201Cshe\u201D. And vice versa.  Use the term and pronoun preferred by the person in question. If that\u2019s unknown \u2013 apply that which fits with the way the person lives publicly.  If reporting on someone who is making their transition public, it may be appropriate to refer to their previous identity to help audience understanding. It may also be appropriate to refer to a transition to make sense of some stories.Transsexual refers to someone who has changed, or wishes to change, their body through medical intervention. Use as an adjective - do not say \u201Ctranssexuals\u201D, in the same way we would not talk about "gays" or "blacks". Transsexual is not an umbrella term. Many transgender people do not identify as transsexual and prefer the word transgender. Try to ask or find out which term a person prefers. Take care with the term \u201Csex change\u201D, unless referring specifically to the surgical element of a transition. It should not be used as a general description for a transgender person.Queer is an adjective used by some people who find more specific terms, such as \u201Clesbian\u201D, \u201Cgay\u201D, \u201Cbisexual\u201D, \u201Ctrans\u201D and \u201CLGBT\u201D, too limiting to describe their romantic or sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression. Originally a pejorative term, more recently \u201Cqueer\u201D has been reclaimed by some in the LGBTQ+ community, to describe themselves. However, it is not universally accepted and has the potential to cause offence. Be careful when using the term. We should not apply the term to an individual or group unless they have already adopted it.Non-binary is an adjective used to describe a person who does not identify as only male or only female, or who may identify as both . It is increasingly common for non-binary people to use the singular pronoun \u201Cthey\u201D. Obviously, we should not ascribe a gender to someone non-binary. But we may need to explain any use of \u201Cthey\u201D as a singular pronoun to the audience for clarity. This could be without explicitly mentioning their gender, however (eg: [First name surname] - who uses "they" and "them" as personal pronouns - is\u2026).\u201CSexual preference\u201D suggests a person chooses to be gay or bisexual. For the same reason, phrases such as \u201Calternative lifestyle\u201D should also be avoided where possible.  Instead of \u201Csexual preference\u201D and \u201Cadmits being gay\u201D, consider \u201Csexual orientation\u201D and \u201Cis gay\u201D.general election ie lower case.`},{word_bbc:"General Synod",meaning_bbc:"Style is to use initial caps.

There are no universal rules on hyphens in many cases, but in general do not overuse. They are required for compound adjectives, as in: "If I come with you in first class, will you buy me a first-class ticket?" But they are not used when part of the adjective is an adverb ending in -ly: "badly researched report", "severely wounded man", "newly cleaned car".

We would say Jim Smith is a father of two but it\u2019s father-of-two Jim Smith. Likewise Jim Smith is 25 years old but 25-year-old Jim Smith.

Phrasal verbs are constructions such as build up, turn out, drive in, take over. Some need hyphens when they are used as nouns. Those ending in -in, -to, -on or -up use a hyphen (check-up, break-in, turn-on). Nouns ending in -off have a hyphen (pay-off, turn-off, drop-off) but those ending in -out do not (payout, turnout, dropout, bailout). Nouns where the second part is four or more letters are one word: takeover, clampdown, giveaway, setback, lookahead, runaround. Rare exceptions are where two vowels need to be separated by a hyphen, as in go-ahead, though this isn't always necessary.

In general, use a hyphen to separate repeated letters in a compound word: re-emergence, co-operative, film-maker, night-time. But there are some exceptions, including overrun, override, overrule, underrate, withhold. As usual, consult the Oxford English Dictionary if in doubt.

If prices are falling, it\u2019s called deflation.In the UK there are two measures for inflation. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measures the year-on-year change of consumer prices based on a basket of goods and services purchased by most households, but excludes the cost of mortgage interest rates. The CPI is the basis of the Bank of England\u2019s official inflation target and is an internationally standardised measure which allows us to compare the UK\u2019s inflation rate with that of other EU countries.The Retail Prices Index, or RPI, is based on the same basket of goods and services, plus mortgages.We should normally mention both rates, because the CPI is usually a key driver for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision, while the RPI is the benchmark for inflation adjustments of state benefits and many wage negotiations.Inflation is a rate - so has to be attached to a period of time (eg: The annual inflation rate rose sharply last month).

However, in headlines we can use numerals for numbers below 10, as in Boy, 8, hurt in rollercoaster crash or Pound falls to 5-year low.

Don\u2019t start a sentence or headline with digits (eg: Fifty MPs have been expelled; Four per cent of the patients have died) except with listicles, where using a digit may better suit the tone of the article.

The same rule works for ordinal numbers: (eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th).

Millions and billions are spelled out, except where they are used with currencies or in headlines (five million people, 10 billion grains of sand, \xA35m). And remember that billion is widely accepted as meaning "one thousand million" (not "one million million").

Fractions are written as words or, where appropriate, as a decimal (eg: three-quarters or 0.75).

With heights, weights etc, follow our usual convention with numbers where the following unit is not an abbreviation eg: They walked two miles (3.22km); The troops are 20 miles (32km) from Baghdad; The child weighed less than two stone (12.7kg) at the time of his death.

But all numbers are expressed as digits if the accompanying units are abbreviated eg: Mr Atlas said he had once weighed 6st 9lb (42.18kg). Anderlecht have signed a striker who is 6ft 8in (2.03m).

Football, rugby etc use digits for scores eg: Arsenal 2-3 Leeds.

Cricket uses digits for all numbers, both in stories and in summaries eg: Anderson took 3-42.

Tennis scores use digits for all numbers, without commas between sets eg: Smith beat Jones 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-4). Note that tiebreak scores are inside brackets and separated by dashes.

Winning margins in matchplay golf are written in digits with an ampersand eg: Morris beat Rose 4&3.

Golf holes are referred to as the 3rd, 4th etc (not "the third", "the fourth" etc).

In Athletics events such as the 100m, where times below 10 seconds are regularly achieved, all numbers should be written as digits - and the word "seconds" need not be used throughout eg: X took gold with a time of 9.93 seconds. In second place was Y, on 9.94. And the bronze medal went to Z, on 9.96.

Elsewhere, the first reference to a time in athletics should spell it out in full, following the usual convention with numbers below 10 eg: one hour two minutes 23.34 seconds (with no commas between units). After that, switch to a more compact style eg: 1:03:25.67.

Insert commas into numbers of four digits and above eg: The race attracted a crowd of 65,000 - but not necessarily in athletics events eg: A smaller crowd watched the final of the men\u2019s 1500m - where the figure is pronounced "fifteen hundred").

The "One" in Formula One is written as a digit eg: Formula 1 or F1.`},{word_bbc:"O2",meaning_bbc:'(ie with cap "O" - not zero) is our style for the name of the company formerly known to its customers as BT Cellnet.'},{word_bbc:"obtuse",meaning_bbc:'means blunt, insensitive, or dull-witted.

Stick to English and say \xA3200 a head or \xA3200 each.percentagesOur usual style is to use digits - even with numbers we would normally write out as words (eg: 8%), but a percentage should be expressed in words if it comes at the beginning of a sentence (eg: Ten per cent of the budget will be devoted to the war effort).There is no such thing as a percent, so don\u2019t say "half a per cent" - it should be a half per cent or half of one per cent.And there is a distinction between percentages and percentage points. If an exam pass rate goes up from 80% to 100%, this is a rise of 20 percentage points - and not "a rise of 20%" - because 20% of 80 is 16.

Occasionally captions in picture galleries might be longer.The wording should follow the geography of a picture, from left to right (eg: if Smith is on the left and Jones on the right, the caption should not say "Jones and Smith").A caption should not be a literal description of the picture - that is the function of an alt tag. It\u2019s important to give the reader enough information to understand what they are looking at independently of the alt tag, while also adding value (eg: Smith and Jones: Lifelong friends). In News, where space allows, use both first and second names of anyone pictured. Sport can follow the sporting convention of surnames only (eg: Robson says he\u2019s putting in for a transfer).For direct quotes, use a colon and double quotation marks (eg: Sheila Vine: \u201CNothing will stop me\u201D). Any colon in a caption, whether or not introducing a quote, must be followed by a capital letter (eg: Lisa Simpson: Genius at work).If you need to focus on one individual among several, use brackets and not commas - so a picture of a group of children might be captioned eg: Bart Simpson (centre) was never his teacher\u2019s pet. If space is short, abbreviate such labels to their initial capital letter only ie (C) (L) or (R). But don\u2019t be too literal if it\u2019s obvious who is who, as in: Boy George (L) chatted to the Queen at Buckingham Palace.There is no full stop at the end of a caption, except in picture galleries. And a caption is often not necessary at all for a map or a generic graphic.'},{word_bbc:"Pin number",meaning_bbc:'ie initial cap only, no hyphen.

No-one in London would ever refer to "Mansfield in England" - they would say Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. So do not write "Kirkcaldy in Scotland" - it should be Kirkcaldy in Fife; similarly not "Tenby in Wales", but Tenby in Pembrokeshire.

But avoid unless the company\u2019s status is relevant to the story."},{word_bbc:"plurals",meaning_bbc:'Some words remain the same even as plurals, such as aircraft, cannon, sheep and fish (although you would use fishes when referring to different kinds of fish, eg He studied freshwater fishes of the UK). Be careful with some words that are plural but often mistakenly used as singular: criteria (criterion), bacteria (bacterium), phenomena (phenomenon). Data is strictly a plural, but we follow common usage and treat it as singular, as we do with agenda.Our preference for words ending in -ium, such as stadium, is stadiums. For index, our favoured plural form (as in stock markets) is indexes. The plural is indices only in a mathematical/scientific context.Watch names when using the plural. If you were writing about a family called Phelps, you would say: The Phelpses were going for a day at the seaside.For words ending in "o", there are no hard and fast rules, though the principle is that most words just add an "s" but there are exceptions. However, there are a few general patterns. If a word is a short version of a longer word, just add an "s": memos, photos, demos. The same applies to words that clearly have their roots in another language, such as stilettos, calypsos, chinos, bistros, casinos. And where a word ends with two vowels, just add an "s", as in videos and cameos. The best way of checking is to take the first version offered by the Oxford English Dictionary, so we would use: avocados, banjos, flamingos, ghettos, manifestos, mementos. Those taking an "e" include: buffaloes, cargoes, dominoes, echoes, embargoes, haloes, heroes, mangoes, mottoes, potatoes, tomatoes, torpedoes, vetoes, volcanoes, tornadoes and mosquitoes (though Tornados and Mosquitos when talking about the planes).'},{word_bbc:"PM",meaning_bbc:'can be used to  mean "prime minister" in headlines, but should be written out in stories.'},{word_bbc:"poet laureate",meaning_bbc:"ie lower case"},{word_bbc:"police ranks",meaning_bbc:`Chief Constable should not be abbreviated in any circumstances. Revert to "Mr", "Mrs" etc at second reference.

Assistant Chief Constable should also be written out in full at first reference - but can then be shortened to ACC. In the Met and City of London police, use Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner etc at first reference then "Mrs Smith", "Sir John" etc.

Other police ranks should be used in abbreviated form, even at first reference: 

Commander - Cdr

Chief Superintendent - Ch Supt

Superintendent - Supt

Chief Inspector - Ch Insp

Inspector - Insp

Sergeant - Sgt

Police Constable - PC

For Detective ranks, put Det in front of the above ranks, except for Detective Constable - Det Con.

There is no longer a rank of WPC, so women police constables should also be PC (and women detective constables Det Con).

Write out ranks in full when not accompanied by a name (eg: It took eight police constables to restrain him).

police and crime commissioners

These elected roles in England and Wales follow the same convention as political titles - capped with the name, lower case on their own.

Afterwards Mr/Mrs/Ms as appropriate.`},{word_bbc:"political parties",meaning_bbc:'The word "party" is capped up when giving the title (eg: the Labour Party) - but is lower case if the full name is dropped (eg: The vote represented a new low in the party\u2019s fortunes).Party names are also capped up if used adjectivally (eg: Portugal\u2019s Social Democrat prime minister) provided the proper party name is used (in full or short-form) - as opposed to a label that summarises a political stance. So, French Socialists would mean paid-up party members, whereas French socialists would mean people in France of a socialist persuasion. But to avoid ambiguity it would be preferable in the first case to say members of the French Socialist Party.'},{word_bbc:"political titles",meaning_bbc:`Political job titles - including all members of a government - have initial caps only when the title is used next to the individual, in whatever order eg:

UK Prime Minister Glenda Goodwin (and not "British Prime Minister Glenda Goodwin")

Foreign Secretary David Jones

Harry Smith, the Home Secretary

Mr Curran, who has been prime minister since 2015.

Any post mentioned without reference to the post-holder should be in lower case e.g: The prime minister will be out of the country for several days.

The same rule applies for former holders of political office (eg: The former President, Jimmy Carter, is to make a political comeback. The former president said he wanted to spend less time with his family).

Similarly, Leader of the Opposition is capped up only if accompanied by the name. Otherwise, opposition portfolios are always lower case, with or without the name (eg: The shadow chancellor, Thomas Hurn, was furious. There was jeering when the shadow chancellor left).   

political parties The word "party" is capped up when giving the title (eg: the Labour Party) - but is lower case if the full name is dropped (eg: The vote represented a new low in the party\u2019s fortunes).`},{word_bbc:"Pope",meaning_bbc:'Always use an initial cap for the Pope, whether or not his name is attached.

The US agencies tend to refer to "earnings", so it is important to check whether or not these include tax and/or "exceptional". Sometimes they mention "earnings per share", which may be useful when making a comparison with the predictions of Wall Street analysts - but generally it is best to focus on the overall profit figure.'},{word_bbc:"program/programme",meaning_bbc:'The spelling without the final "-me" should be used only when using the noun/exact phrase "computer program/computer programs".

(But quotation marks will be single if the phrase comes inside a direct quotation (eg: The minister said: \u201CThe spread of \u2018mad cow disease\u2019 has ruined thousands of lives.\u201D) Either way, no punctuation is required after the first reference.

No quotation marks are required for film, TV or song titles. Use initial caps to indicate that it is a title (eg: Madonna's early chart-toppers include Into the Groove and La Isla Bonita). 

When referring to a nickname or similar, it\u2019s either lower case and quotes or caps and no quotes, eg Mrs Thatcher was known as the Iron Lady.`},{word_bbc:"quotations",meaning_bbc:`A direct quotation, or a series of direct quotes, can capture the essence of a story - but select only the best lines. Put the rest into indirect speech, or leave it out altogether.

Ensure the quotation is comprehensible and makes sense. Do not expose a speaker to ridicule by bringing his/her grammatical/linguistic incompetence to a wider audience. Again, a combination of indirect speech and omission should solve the problem.

Never anticipate a direct quote by using its main point in the cue-line (eg: The minister promised free beer for all. He told the party conference: "There will be free beer for all.")

With complete sentences, the closing quotation marks go after the full stop (eg: Mr Franklin said: "This is a farce."). When quoting a single word or phrase, the quotation marks go before the full stop (eg: Mr Franklin called the episode "a farce".).

Where you want to indicate that a sentence is unfinished, or that part of a quote has been omitted, use triple dots (eg: "I believe the way forward is clear\u2026 there is no alternative."). The space should be after, not before the dots in order to avoid a new line beginning with dots.

When using snippets of a quote, make sure they are worth quoting. Mr Jones said he was "gobsmacked" by the award is fine. But Mr Jones said he was "surprised" and "never thought" he would win is best left as indirect speech`},{word_bbc:"Quran (updated March 2021)",meaning_bbc:"is our spelling of the Islamic sacred book - not Qur\u2019an or Koran"},{word_bbc:"race",meaning_bbc:'race and/or ethnicity should be mentioned only when relevant.For example, it could be an important identifying factor in the case of a missing person.race is the legally protected characteristic in UK law.

BAME is best avoided unless within direct quotes or when it is a stated parameter of a report or study - and only in a UK context, as it is not a term used anywhere else. There is a low level of understanding of the term among many audiences and it should be defined in the accompanying text.It\u2019s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) at first mention, BAME at second reference and in headlines, ie follows our usual rule for initialisms of all capitals with no full stops or spaces.It can include anyone who identifies as belonging to an ethnicity other than white British, including:And it is usually better to use this more specific terminology where possible. If an umbrella term is necessary, however, (people belonging to) ethnic minorities is preferred. Avoid "non-whites".\u201Cimmigrant\u201D is often wrongly used to describe someone born in the UK. Instead of \u201Cshe is from an immigrant family\u201D, consider \u201Cher family settled in the UK from India\u201D, for example.people of colour, which is used in the US, obviously excludes entirely white ethnic minorities but, even when this is the intention, it is also best avoided in copy and scripts unless within direct quotes or when it is a stated parameter of a report or study.  Avoid \u201Cbrown\u201D, unless in the words of a contributor.Many Hispanic and/or Latino Americans identify as people of colour but others, who prefer to emphasise their European heritage, do not.And the same is true of East Asian and South East Asian Americans. Similarly, the more specific black Americans, where relevant, is preferred to people of colour. Caribbean Americans and Africans living in the US do not generally identify as African American, even if they are black. And African American is, therefore, best avoided other than to differentiate between these groups, within direct quotes or when it is a stated parameter of a report or study. If referring to specific individuals, where possible and appropriate reflect how they self-identify. The Duchess of Sussex and Oona King identify as mixed race, for example, whileBarack Obama and Lewis Hamilton identify as black.Kamala Harris identifies as black and South Asian American.

What determines this is the tense used in introducing the indirect speech.For example, imagine Harold Higgins says: "I am resigning" (ie he uses the present tense). If you introduce this with either the present tense ("He says") or the perfect tense ("He has said"), then you should retain the present tense within the quotation: ie the text can say either Harold Higgins says he is resigning or Harold Higgins has said he is resigning.If you opt for the past tense ("He said"), then you have to "knock back" by one tense from that used in the original eg: Mr Higgins said he was resigning. By the same rule, if Mr Higgins\u2019 next words are "I saw the Queen on Tuesday", then you can write either Mr Higgins says/has said he saw the Queen on Tuesday or Mr Higgins said he had seen the Queen on Tuesday. With remarks looking to future events, the word "will" survives into reported speech only if the introduction uses the present or perfect tense. Thus: if Mr Higgins continues: "I will leave No 10 on Saturday" - then this can become either Mr Higgins says he will leave No 10 on Saturday or Mr Higgins has said he will leave No 10 on Saturday. But if you use the past tense as an introduction then "will" becomes "would" - eg: Mr Higgins said he would leave No 10 on Saturday.'},{word_bbc:"responsibility",meaning_bbc:'You can sidestep the whole debate over the suitability of such phrases as "Hamas says it was responsible" by substituting eg: Hamas says it planted the bomb.'},{word_bbc:"Retail Prices Index/RPI",meaning_bbc:"ie initial caps.

Substitute journalists, business leaders, police officers etc, as appropriate.'},{word_bbc:"sexual offences",meaning_bbc:'Our policy is dictated by the need to protect the identity of victims of sexual offences. A frequent problem has been "jigsaw identification" in cases of offences within the family - where the victim\u2019s identity can be deduced because some of the media name the accused and others specify the offence. In line with most of the media, our usual practice is to name the accused, but not the specific charge - instead, saying "a serious sexual offence". This means we do not refer to specific cases of incest, or of rape or sexual assault within the family. If in doubt over a specific case, refer to the Editorial Policy Unit.The terms child pornography or child porn trivialise the nature of what is criminal material. We should use other language such as "images that show child sex abuse" or "indecent images of children". In headlines and/or summaries, use child abuse images.  Technically paedophile is a clinical term for someone with a sexual attraction to children, but the meaning has widened to take in various forms of child sex abuse and associated images.Technically paedophile is a clinical term for someone with a sexual attraction to children, but the meaning has widened to take in various forms of child sex abuse and associated images.However, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 draws a distinction between children under 13 and those aged 13-16. For instance, it is deemed that any child under 13 will not have given consent to any sexual activity. But where someone is accused or convicted of a sexual relationship with a child aged 13-16 we should weigh up the information available before describing them as a paedophile.The word is often inappropriate as an adjective - rather than talking about "paedophile pictures", refer to images of child sex abuse.Finally, people are put on the sex offenders register - lower case and no apostrophe.'},{word_bbc:"shadow",meaning_bbc:"In a political context, the word shadow is always lower case - whether the reference is to the shadow cabinet or to an individual politician, with or without the name (eg: The shadow health secretary backed the proposal.

There are some exceptions:Press and public should be treated as singular, but rewording may be advisable (replacing eg: "The press arrived soon afterwards. It had lots of questions"  with Journalists arrived soon afterwards. They had lots of questions.) Be consistent within a story (eg: don\u2019t say "The jury has retired to consider its verdict" followed by "The jury are spending the night at a hotel"). Some words remain the same even as plurals, such as aircraft, cannon, sheep and fish (although you would use fishes when referring to different kinds of fish, eg He studied freshwater fishes of the UK). Be careful with some words that are plural but often mistakenly used as singular: criteria (criterion), bacteria (bacterium), phenomena (phenomenon).  Data is strictly a plural, but we follow common usage and treat it as singular, as we do with agenda. Our preference for words ending in -ium, such as stadium, is stadiums. For index, our favoured plural form (as in stock markets) is indexes. The plural is indices only in a mathematical/scientific context.Watch names when using the plural. If you were writing about a family called Phelps, you would say: The Phelpses were going for a day at the seaside.For words ending in "o", there are no hard and fast rules, though the principle is that most words just add an "s", but there are exceptions. However, there are a few general patterns. If a word is a short version of a longer word, just add an "s": memos, photos, demos. The same applies to words that clearly have their roots in another language, such as stilettos, calypsos, chinos, bistros, casinos. And where a word ends with two vowels, just add an "s" as in videos and cameos.The best way of checking is to take the first version offered by the Oxford English Dictionary, so we would use: avocados, banjos, flamingos, ghettos,manifestos,mementos. Those taking an "e" include: buffaloes, cargoes, dominoes, echoes, embargoes, haloes, heroes, mangoes, mottoes, potatoes, tomatoes, torpedoes, vetoes, volcanoes, tornadoes and mosquitoes (though Tornados and Mosquitos when talking about the planes).'},{word_bbc:"sky marshal",meaning_bbc:'(undercover anti-terrorist agent on commercial aircraft) ie spelt with single "l".'},{word_bbc:"slam",meaning_bbc:"A word to be avoided in headlines - use criticise, condemn, dismiss etc."},{word_bbc:"slate",meaning_bbc:'is a word that is liable to cause confusion.

Sometimes, when a tweet is full of mistakes it may be best to leave it as it is.

Within copy, too, always use digits eg: 4-0 (and never "4-nil", or "four-nil").

Cricket uses digits for all numbers, both in stories and in summaries eg: Anderson took 3-42.

Tennis scores use digits for all numbers, without commas between sets eg: Smith beat Jones 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-4). Note that tiebreak scores are inside brackets and separated by dashes.

Winning margins in matchplay golf are written in digits with an ampersand eg: Morris beat Rose 4&3.

Golf holes are referred to as the 3rd, 4th etc (not "the third", "the fourth" etc).

In Athletics events such as the 100m, where times below 10 seconds are regularly achieved, all numbers should be written as digits - and the word "seconds" need not be used throughout eg: X took gold with a time of 9.93 seconds. In second place was Y, on 9.94. And the bronze medal went to Z, on 9.96.

Elsewhere, the first reference to a time in athletics should spell it out in full, following the usual convention with numbers below 10 eg: one hour two minutes 23.34 seconds (with no commas between units). After that, switch to a more compact style eg: 1:03:25.67.

Insert commas into numbers of four digits and above eg: The race attracted a crowd of 65,000 - but not necessarily in athletics events eg: A smaller crowd watched the final of the men\u2019s 1500m - where the figure is pronounced "fifteen hundred").

The Arabic translates as the Noble Sanctuary.terroristThe word "terrorist" is not banned, but its use can be a barrier rather than an aid to understanding. We should try to avoid the use of the term without attribution. We should convey to our audience the full consequences of the act by describing what happened.

Our responsibility is to remain objective and report in ways that enable our audiences to make their own assessments about who is doing what to whom.While care is needed when describing perpetrators, an action or event can be described as a terror attack or an act of terror.When we do use the term we should strive to do so with consistency in the stories we report across all our services, and in a way that does not undermine our reputation for objectivity and accuracy. It is also very important that we strive for consistency across the international and UK facing sites.

World stories put local time first, followed by conversion into GMT. Domestic stories which mention overseas local time should convert into UK time eg: The foreign secretary will leave London immediately after the cabinet meeting - arriving in Washington at 11:00 local time (16:00 BST). In a story with several time references, we don\u2019t need to use BST/GMT on every occasion; establishing the time zone once should be enough. Also, judge whether it adds anything in a historical sense, as in: "The court heard Jones had burgled the house at 14:25 GMT in November last year."Days: Since our international users live in various time zones, we must not use "yesterday", "this morning", "today", "tonight", "tomorrow" etc. Instead, days should be referred to by name (eg: Voting begins on Monday) - and we should not follow the American custom of omitting the preposition (eg: "Voting begins Monday"). When writing about events which have happened or are due to happen on the day a story appears, we should avoid putting the day of the week in the top four pars. If some indication of timescale is needed, use another form of words such as "within hours", "shortly", "later" or "earlier". If there is scope for confusion, include the day lower down the story.Seasons: For similar reasons, references to the seasons should be kept to a minimum. We should not say eg: "An election will be held in the spring". Substitute with An election will be held in five months\u2019 time - or similar.Dates: Put the day before the month (eg: 12 April 2001). One exception: in a US context, we should spell out the Fourth of July. Do not include suffixes after the day (eg "20th").Decades: are written 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, ie with no apostrophe before the "s". But there should be one at the start of a date if you omit the century - eg: The oil crisis of \u201873 or when an adjective is attached - eg: the Swinging '60s. Digits are also used in the decades of an individual\u2019s age (eg: Henry Higgins is now in his mid-50s).Centuries: with an initial cap if labelled with a number (eg: 21st Century).

In the first of these groups, the first name is not used, so it is Lady Hermon rather than Lady Sylvia Hermon. But those in the second group do include their first name in the title (eg: Lady Antonia Fraser is the daughter of the late Lord Longford, the surname having changed when she married).

But when there is space we should also report the claimant count numbers - especially to give a historical perspective.In the context of the "claimant count" (jargon - to be avoided), the phrase "out of work and claiming benefit" is often used - when what it actually means is successfully claiming benefit.

And, in a UK-wide story, do not write eg: "the recent sunny weather" - just because it happens to have been sunny where you are.'},{word_bbc:"website",meaning_bbc:"ie one word, and lower case."},{word_bbc:"weights and measures",meaning_bbc:'We should use both imperial and metric measures in most stories. Context will usually decide which measure comes first, but if the first figure is part of a quote it should be retained, with a conversion in brackets immediately afterwards.Where instantly recognisable abbreviations exist, these should be used throughout, even at first reference. For example, the words "metre" and "kilometre" are not written out in full even at first reference; use the abbreviations m and km. All numbers preceding abbreviations should be rendered as digits; where units are written out in full, our usual numbers convention is followed. There should not be a gap between number and abbreviated unit, and units of measurement do not in general take an "s" in the plural.UK and US stories should usually use imperial first - eg: He said the first 50ft (15.24m) of the climb had been hard. The president\u2019s campaign helicopter has taken him more than 2,000 miles (3,200km).For feet and inches, use digits followed by abbreviations - eg: The hedge was exactly 9ft 4in high (2.84m).In non-UK/US stories, metric should usually come first - with a bracketed conversion to imperial - eg: Police in France say the floods reached a peak of 5.3m (17ft 8in). Many fugitives from English justice are living along a 10km (6.2 mile) stretch of the Spanish coast.Sometimes logic will dictate when metric should come first (eg: Train speeds on the British side of the Channel Tunnel compare badly with French top speeds of 300km/h (186.4mph).A nanometre is one thousand millionth of a metre. Spell it out in full at first reference; then trim to nm, with the accompanying number expressed as digit(s) eg: 6nm, 52nm.For weights originally expressed as a precise number of stone, write out the word "stone" (never "stones") - and follow our usual convention with any accompanying number - eg: The child weighed less than two stone (12.7kg) at the time of his death; She said the company had sacked her because she weighed 15 stone (95.3kg).But if pounds are involved you should use the abbreviations st and lb (not "lbs"), and use digits even for numbers below 10, with no gap between number and unit - eg: Charles Atlas said he had once weighed 6st 9lb (42.18kg).From a gram (one thousandth of a kilogram), the abbreviation g is used at first reference and throughout. This rule applies whether singular or plural. It is lower case, and there is no gap between number and unit - eg: Police say they found 30g (1oz) of cannabis in the woman\u2019s handbag.For volumes, the usual approach, again, is to use both metric and imperial - eg: The tanker was carrying 30,000 gallons (136,000 litres) of petrol. (Note that "litres" is not abbreviated, because "l" looks like a number one.) However, phrases where volume and liquid are historically almost inseparable do not have to be converted - eg: He told the court his favourite pastime was to go out with his friends for a curry and a pint. Thus, a pint of beer or a pint of blood are acceptable, unconverted, in any story - though context will sometimes make a metric conversion appropriate in, say, Technology or Health.Adjectival phrases defining areas should include hyphens in both metric and imperial measures. Always mention both; the context will determine which comes first - eg: The French fishermen denied reports that they had been operating inside the X-sq-km (Y-sq-mile) zone (Note: there is no "s" on nouns used adjectivally). Elsewhere, there is no need for hyphens - eg: The UK government is calling for a ban on fishing within a zone of X sq miles (Y sq km).Abbreviations should be used throughout. Never write "square kilometres", but always sq km. There is no acceptable abbreviation for "miles", so write sq miles (and, adjectivally, sq-mile).With Sports stories, be guided by the traditions of the individual sport in deciding which system of measurement should be given prominence. For a cricket match in the Netherlands, it should be imperial; for an athletics meeting there, it would be metric. But conversions will always help to reach a wider audience eg: Anderlecht have signed a striker who is 6ft 8in tall (2.03m).'},{word_bbc:"Welsh assembly",meaning_bbc:'Use lower case for eg: The problems facing farmers will be discussed by the Welsh assembly.

If the answer is "he", "she" or "they", then the clause should begin with who. If the answer is "him", "her" or "them", then it should be whom - eg: Mr Smith ignored Mr Clarke, whom he disliked is correct, because he disliked "him".
