    <title>Looking at COVID vaccines</title>

    <div class="center-content">
        <h1>I was curious why different vaccines produce slightly different results.</h1>
        <h2>So, I inspected!</h2>
        <p>
            On CDC’s website, the words explaining vaccine ingredients for both Pfizer and Moderna start with the same
            two
            sentences:
        </p>
        <p>All covid-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. nearly all the ingredients in covid-19 vaccines are ingredients
            found in many foods—fats, sugars, and salts. the <insert name of vaccine> COVID-19 vaccine also contains a
                harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). </p>
        <p>This, and the fact that different pharma companies’ vaccines showed different efficiency ratings in testing,
            got me thinking how different are they anyway? Since they’re all meant to fight COVID-19, aren’t they bound
            to be fairly similar in composition? I’m no biochemist, of course, but I wanted an easily digestible,
            data-backed explanation for myself. So, here we are!</p>
        <p><a
                href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/full-fda-approval-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-should-know#:~:text=The%20Pfizer%2FBioNTech%20and%20Moderna,and%20Drug%20Administration%20(FDA).">The
                Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have received full approval by the Food and Drug
                Administration (FDA).</a></p>
        <p>COVID Vaccines: Emergency Use Authorization vs. Approval</p>
        <p>Not every vaccine is granted an emergency use authorization before full approval. The FDA authorized three
            COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) to answer an urgent need to protect people from
            the coronavirus pandemic, which was (and continues to be) a public health emergency.</p>
        <p>And not every authorized vaccine becomes fully approved. For example, in December 2021, due to potential
            blood clots following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC updated its recommendations.
            The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson
            vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>Full approval is granted when, over time, the FDA has amassed even more scientific evidence to support use of
            the COVID-19 vaccines, showing that the benefits of the vaccine are greater than its risks, and that the
            vaccines can be manufactured reliably, safely and with consistent quality.</p>
