            Where's the best Biryani at?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dum, Lucknowi, Thalassery, with or without potatoes … Indians have opinions about our Biryani. We even like to
        argue if the vegetable version even qualifies as Biryani — but we’ll save that debate for another day!
        <br><br>
        But, which city has the best Biryani? I came up with a data-driven solution to settle one of the country’s
        biggest divides! Using Zomato.com, I scraped information on restaurants that deliver Biryani in six cities:
        Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Kolkata and Bangalore. While I think only Hyderabad, Lucknow and Kolkata
        qualify for the race, I figured I’d give the other three a chance too.
        <br><br>
        I scraped user ratings and price ranges. Note that this dataset has a few flaws that I want to mention upfront.
        First, it is a database of 544 restaurants listed on Zomato, which we’re assuming to be fairly representative,
        owing to the fact that Zomato serves over 32 million users each month, according to an Economic Times report.
        <br><br>
        Second, albeit a smaller one; the ratings could be skewed by users’ delivery experience on a particular day and
        not necessarily reflective of the taste.
        <br><br>
        In the dataset, most entries were from Bangalore — at 101, followed by 99 from Lucknow. The least number of
        entries were, surprisingly, from Hyderabad — the southern city that’s famous for its spicy dum-style biryani.
        <br><br>
        For the price ranges, we like our Biryani cheap and nice. Most places in the database serve Biryani, for one,
        for ₹100, which is about $1.3.
        <br><br>
        Can you guess which city has the most (yummies!!) and cheapest Biryani? Kolkata has the cheapest Biryani selling
        portions for one for ₹112 on average.
        <br><br>
        The cheapest places in the dataset also are from Kolkata with eight of them selling Biryani for ₹50. And,
        they’re rated pretty highly too!
        <br><br>
        The highest rated place, Chittoda's Suruchee Restaurant has a whopping 4.4 out of 5 rating! I wondered if that
        was a Zomato users only opinion, but, the rating checks out from their Google rating of 4.3.
        <br><br>
        I dove deep into their reviews and looks like people love them!
