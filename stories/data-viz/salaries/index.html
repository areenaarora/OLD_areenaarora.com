        <p>
            Between 2017-2021, 805 out of over 127,000 city employees worked more hours in overtime than regular hours.
            These 805 employees are from 39 of the 150 agencies on city's payroll. This is a data exercise into what
            their payroll data can tell us.
        </p>
        <p>The data for this story is sourced from <a
                href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/data" ;
                target="_blank">NYC Open Data.</a></p>
        <p>Of these 805 employees, 284 are from the Police Department, followed by the Department of Parks and
            Recreation and the Fire Department.</p>
        <p>For most Parks & Rec employees, their regular work hours were listed to be below zero in the dataset. The
            data dictionary doesn't offer any details into how that could happen. For now on, we'll therefore focus
            mostly on the Police and Fire Departments.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size:25px; font-weight: lighter;">Let's take a closer look with some quick charts!</h2>
        <!-- Chart one with all three agencies -->
        <p>Some employees, mostly from the Department of Parks & Rec, had negative regular hours listed. So, narrowing
            down to those with a positive number of regular hours worked.</p>
        <p>That narrows down the dataset to 41 employees who:
            <li>Worked more overtime hours than regular hours</li>
            <li>Worked at least one regular hour</li>
            <li>Are from the Fire or Police Departments</li>
        </p>
        <p>Interestingly, of these 41 employees, 40 are no longer on the city payroll. Together these 40 people made a little over $580,000 in overtime pay
             Let's dig deeper!</p>
        <p>Who are these 40 employees?</p>
        <p>Twenty five of these were employed with in Brooklyn.</p>
