        <p>Data from NYC city payroll shows how three employees NYC Housin Authority and the Department of Health/Mental Hygiene made over $220,000 in overtime pay.</p>
        

        <!-- Overall high chart -->
        <!-- All three of these employees' titles are plumbers -->

        <p>
            Between 2017-2021, 1556 out of over 142,000 city employees worked more hours in overtime than regular hours.
            They represent 49 of the 150 agencies on city's payroll. This is a data exercise into what
            their payroll data can tell us, without any journalistic interviews.
        </p>
        <p>The data for this story is sourced from <a
                href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/data" ;
                target="_blank">NYC Open Data.</a></p>
        <p>Of these 1556 employees, 432 are from the Police Department, followed by 184 from the Department of
            Children's Services and 150 from Parks & Recreation Department.</p>
        <p>For 581 employees, their regular work hours were listed to be below zero in the dataset. The
            data dictionary doesn't offer any details into how that could happen. For now on, we'll therefore focus
            mostly on the ones that have positive regular hours worked noted.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size:25px; font-weight: lighter;">Let's take a closer look with some quick charts!</h2>

        <!-- Chart one with all three agencies -->

        <p>That narrows down the dataset to 975 employees who:
            <li>Worked more overtime hours than regular hours</li>
            <li>Worked at least one regular hour</li>
            <li>Worked for either NYPD, Children's Services or Parks and Recreation</li>
        </p>
        <p>This is a purely arbitrary editorial choice, and is just one of the many, many possibilities with this dataset.</p>
        <p>From this, I found that 32 employees, who worked in Manhattan, made a total of over $2.6 million in overtime pay over the five year-period.</p>


        <!--  Manhattan chart -->
        
        
        <p>Interestingly, of the 975 employees filtered earlier, 70 are no longer on the city payroll. Together these  people made a
            little over $12,000, on averae, in overtime pay. This compares to about $3,625 average for the entire dataset.
            Let's dig deeper!</p>
        <p>Who are these 40 employees?</p>
