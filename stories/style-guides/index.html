            I want to preface this presentation with saying I don’t have strong opinions about these newsrooms and
            that’s completely unrelated to the fact that I’m looking for a job … no seriously available starting August.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">In May 2020, when George Floyd was murdered during an arrest in Minneapolis, it
            sparked nationwide protests as you may all recall. In the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests then the
            conversation around police brutality was brought to center stage.
            Something changed in newsrooms.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Newsrooms across the country, from The New York Times to Atlantic, AP, Columbia
            Journalism Review responded by announcing that they’ve updated their style guides to capitalize the world
            “Black”</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">But, this isn’t new. And it’s not just the word “Black” that has been brought to
            mainstream discussion. There’s more.</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Reuters refrains from using the word “terrorist” and advices using more “specific
            terms” like bomber, hijacker, attacker or gunman.</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">But, let’s take a step back. Why should we even care? What’s the point of all of this?
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">It’s because our readers care. In their book Global Terrorism and New Media writers
            Philip Seib and Dana Janbek point out that despite our best efforts to remain neutral, journalists’
            influence is unavoidable. Philip is a journalist and Dana is a communications scholar and researcher.</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font"><strong>Our word choices matter.</strong></p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Which brings me to this project. I decided to create a unified database — a
            one-stop-shop if you will— to compare different newsrooms and the word choices they make.</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Why? For one, I was curious. But more importantly to see if these style guides
            accurately capture the times we live in and their readerships’ priorities.</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">I started with BBC, BuzzFeed, NPR, Guardian and Reuters. These five reflect a pretty
            wide ranging audience and also because they were available online for free!</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Here’s what I learned!</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">On something like abortion, newsrooms tend to agree and advice against using
            “pro-life” or “pro-choice</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">Going back to my initial example of the word “terrorist”; here’s what the newsrooms I
            scraped have to say!</p>
        <p class="aboutme-p-font">For BBC, the word terrorist in itself isn’t banned, but the style guide advices
            journalists to be cautious with using it. NPR makes a solid case for using very precise language. The
            Guardian refers to UN’s definition of terrorism</p>
