            <p>
                Over two years ago, our lives came to a standstill ‚Äî abruptly ‚Äî unleashing a kind of chaos never seen
                before. The word "unprecedented" was used at an unprecented rate. The confusion led to conspiracy
                theories and added to the hysteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                On CDC‚Äôs website, the words explaining vaccine ingredients for both Pfizer and Moderna start with the
                same two sentences:</p>
            <p><mark>
                    All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are
                    ingredients found in many foods‚Äîfats, sugars, and salts. The <insert name of vaccine> COVID-19
                        vaccine
                        also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA).</mark></p>
            <p>
                This, and the fact that different pharma companies‚Äô vaccines showed different efficiency ratings in
                testing, got me thinking how different are they anyway? Since they‚Äôre all meant to fight COVID-19,
                aren‚Äôt they bound to be fairly similar in composition? I‚Äôm no biochemist, of course, but I wanted an
                easily digestible, data-backed explanation for myself. So, here we are!
            </p>
            <p>
                üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ + üìä + üìù = this
            </p>
            <p>
                But first, a quick recap!
