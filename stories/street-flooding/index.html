    <p>When Hurricane Ida hit the city last September, New Yorkers shared images and videos of flooded subway stations
        and streets on social media. While some blamed climate change, others blamed the city’s poorly kept
        infrastructure, or both.</p>
    <h2>“We had fewer extreme weather events a decade or so ago — maybe one or two a year. Lately, it’s been five to six
        every year,” meteorologist John Davitt said. “Ida’s case wasn’t a failure of planning. It was a climate gone
        crazy situation.”</h2>
    <p>In 2021, there were 10 flash-flood warnings issued for the city, according to data archived by Iowa State
        University. That’s the highest it’s been since 2006, the earliest available year in the dataset.</p>
    <p>Hurricane Ida brought 7.13 inches of rain on Sept. 1, which was the city’s fifth highest daily amount, Reuters
        reported last year. It also broke a record set just two weeks earlier by Hurricane Henri.</p>
    <p>The storm killed 13 people in the city, according to a report prepared by the mayor’s office.</p>
    <h2>“Ida was an eye opener … We didn’t think that type of flooding happened here,” Davitt said.</h2>
    <p>Queens resident Charlton D’souza recalls how the hurricane affected his neighborhood. </p>
    <h2>“We were all afraid our houses were going to get damaged. Several of my neighbors lost their appliances and
        furniture due to flooding damage,” he said. “When buses were pulling up at the bus stops, it caused a tidal wave
        pushing more water into houses.”</h2>
    <p>Between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022, New Yorkers lodged over 67,000 street flooding-related complaints
        with the city government. </p>
    <p>A recent study by researchers from The City College of New York at the NOAA Center for Earth System Sciences and
        Remote Sensing Technologies takes a residents’ eye approach to the problem.</p>
    <p>The study, published in December 2021 in the Journal of Hydrology, looked at 311 complaints from 2010 to 2019 to
        map out, by zip code, which areas in the city get hit hardest by flooding. </p>
    <p>Three-one-one is a residents’ hotline used to report non-urgent problems. For street flooding related issues, the
        complaints are routed to the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
    <p>Of the five boroughs, Staten Island is the least populated with 470,000 residents, according to the 2020 census.
        Yet the borough reported the highest number of flooding complaints during the decade included in the study. </p>
    <p>For 2020, 2021 and the beginning of this year, data from the same source shows a different trend, with most
        complaints lodged by Queens residents, followed by Brooklynites. That said, broken down by zip codes, the
        highest number of complaints come from one particular zip code: Staten Island’s 10314. Over 1700 complaints were
        reported from the zip code in just a year and a half.</p>
    <p>In 2020, the city announced a $6 million infrastructure upgrade to tackle street flooding on Staten Island.</p>
    <h2>“The problem with urban flooding is that it’s hard to locate exactly where it’s happening,” Candace Agonafir,
        one of the study’s co-authors said.</h2>
    <p>For the study, the choice to break data down to zip code level was a strategic one, Naresh Devineni, another co-author of the study, said.</p>
    <p>The inspiration behind the study was just that: a quest to find exactly where flooding occurs and potentially use
        the findings for future city planning.</p>
    <h2>“We thought: What could be a better way than crowd sourcing for our data?” Agonafir said.</h2>
    <p>Being able to plot complaints on a granular zip code level is “good news” Agonafir said, adding that it can aid
        in city planning. </p>
    <p>While precipitation remained the biggest factor in predicting street flooding, the study found that for 21% of
        the city’s 197 zip codes manhole overflow complaints were significant to predicting street flooding. </p>
    <p>While the findings didn’t particularly surprise Agonafir and Devineni, one
        conclusion did get their attention — that catch basins-related complaints are a predictor for street flooding
        complaints. The study found that these complaints predicted street flooding in 47% zip codes in the city.</p>
    <p>Catch basins are street gutters that open into sewers and are meant to prevent water clogging on streets.</p>
    <p>The annual rainfall in New York City is about 1,270 millimeters, or 50 inches, according to the National Weather
        Service. The average number of days it rains in the city is 134, according to data cited in the study. </p>
    <p>Devitt, whose career spans over two decades, provided historical context. </p>
    <h2>“Rainfall records for the city go back to the late 1800s ... This past summer, twice, we set records for the
        most amount of rain in a single hour,” he said.</h2>
    <p>Post Ida, in 2021, the then City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $2.1 billion funding plan for the city’s
        Department of Environmental Protection. The administration also announced the creation of a new position at the
        City Hall — an Extreme Weather Coordinator.</p>
    <h2>“The city is more proactive now in how they communicate,” Devitt said. “They put an emphasis on alerting the
        public as early as possible … The city seems to play catch up a lot.”</h2>
    <p>For his neighborhood, D'souza said, the easiest solution can really just be to pump water out regularly.</p>
    <p>Flood forecasting is easier if complaints are localized to zip code level, according to the study.</p>
    <h2>“Infrastructure is failing at a lower threshold now compared to a decade or so ago,” Devitt said.</h2>
    <p>D’souza agrees. While he thinks climate change is responsible for the flooding, he also places the onus on city
        planning, poor infrastructural upkeep and residents’ behavior for causing street flooding.</p>
    <h2>“On my block, we’ve always had flooding,” D'souza said. “I’m not even close to water.”</h2>
    <h2>“We have old sewer systems … but with that in mind, we have to be careful with what we’re dumping down the
        drain,” he said, adding that people tend to be careless about proper waste disposal. For example, during the
        pandemic, residents became “careless” about how they discarded waste such as plastic gloves, D’souza said, which
        led to increases in drain pipes getting clogged. </h2>
    <p>City’s department of environmental protection could not be reached for comments.</p>
    <h2>“Manhattan is the new Miami,” Devitt said. “We have to future proof the city.”</h2>
