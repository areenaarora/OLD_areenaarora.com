        <p>A cloud burst on a June afternoon in 2013 caused massive floods and landslides in the North Indian state of
            Uttarakhand.</p>
        <p>Uttarakhand is nested in the Himalayas with over 80% of the state land being mountainous. The terrain has
            long been a cause of concern when it comes to developing infrastructure there. It is also known as Dev
            Bhoomi, land of the Gods, home to major Hindu temples and pilgrimage sites.</p>
        <p>It’s estimated that over 6,000 lives were lost in the tragedy. Unofficially, local residents claim the number
            is far higher. Kanha Guru, a Hindu priest, who is based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, a state just south of
            Uttarakhand, grew up in Guptkashi and spent his summers at Kedarnath temple where the floods hit the
            hardest.</p>
        <p>Guru’s family saw the tragedy first-hand, and a day after the devastation, he made his way to his native
            village. Almost nine years later, the tragedy and the visuals from then are still fresh in his eyes.</p>
        <p>“Nobody can forget the tragedy,” he said. “The journey that used to take me a day and a half from Lucknow
            took almost five days this time. I walked, trekked and made my way any way I could.”</p>
        <p>Until he reached his village, he had no news of who from his family was alive and who wasn’t. “Government
            hadn’t started declaring deaths until about two weeks or so after the floods,” he said. He recalled rescue
            operations being very slow, but he’s not angry about it.</p>
        <p>“Everything was disrupted. The roads were flooded, weather was terrible. You cannot even expect rescue
            operation in such conditions,” he said. “Nobody knew where anyone was. There was no way in or out. Even
            helicopters couldn’t fly in.” He was able to trace down his family members but he lost some close childhood
            friends of his.</p>
        <p>“My eyes tear up when I think of them even today … we spent our entire childhood together,” he said. “Even
            after all these years, the memories make me shiver.” Guru’s town Guptkashi is about 70 kms (about 44 miles)
            from Kedarnath, a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, which attracts thousands every summer for
            pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>Guru last visited Kedarnath a year before the floods hit — in 2012 — and couldn’t bring himself to go back up
            until 2019. “I didn’t feel like going. My friends died there,” he said.</p>
        <h3>“When the water came gushing down, houses and people came crashing down like a deck of cards. Nobody could
            help anyone, even if they wanted to, he said”</h3>
        <p>India is a land of mystic stories. Everywhere you go, especially in famous temple towns, people will narrate
            stories, passed down through generations, about miracles happening. One such, unfolded during the
            Uttarakhand floods.</p>
        <p>With the heavy flow of water, a massive rock was brought down. The rock rolled up to the temple and perched
            right behind it.
            <br><br>
            “The temple is so big and there was water reaching its height … But, by Bhole Nath’s (Lord Shiva) grace, a
            large rock came and landed itself behind the temple,” Guru said.
            <br><br>
            The rock has since been named “Bhim Shila”, meaning the divine rock. Pilgrims now pray in front of the rock,
            seeking its blessings, Guru added.
        </p>
        <p>Although there is no confirmed report on this, the temple is commonly thought to be over a thousand years old
            — not unheard of in India.</p>
        <p>When the rock came crashing down, it protected the old temple. Notably, eye witnesses, according to Guru,
            said nobody saw the rock coming down. When the chaos calmed down a bit and people bravely came out from
            hiding to look for their loved ones, they saw the rock, he added.
            <br><br>
            “It wasn’t there before. Nobody saw it coming,” he said. “The rock divided the water stream into two and
            slowed its speed a bit. It saved the temple.”
            <br><br>
            Right outside the temple is a statue of Nandi Bail, Lord Shiva’s ride, a bull. The statue sits in open air,
            unprotected by anything, survived untouched. “It’s Devik Shakti” (God’s grace), Guru said.
        </p>
        <h3>“It all lasted less than a minute. It took less than a minute for our lives to change,” Guru said.</h3>
        <p>“I don’t know the science behind how it all happened,” Guru said. He said he’s since learned that a cloud
            burst in a small pond north of the temple caused the havoc.</p>

            “I used to go there to bathe and play as a child and nobody thought that pond could even have as much water.
            I don’t know what is true and what’s not, but something mysterious happened that day,” he said. The extent
            of the damage makes him tremble even all these years later.
            <br><br>
            “Everything behind the temple was razed. Everything was wiped out … People couldn’t save each other … we all
            tried, but couldn’t. When homes were being wiped out, what are humans. There was no drinking water, no food,
            no clothing left. Some people also died of hunger, thirst and cold,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>“Shankar ji (another name for Lord Shiva) reminded us he’s still here … he saved us but also taught us a
            lesson,” Guru said. “In less than half a minute, where the water came from where it went nobody knows.”
            <br><br>
            Guru volunteered in community-driven rescue efforts. “When people began looking for their loved ones, they
            could hear cries of help from the thick marsh that was created by the flooding … But we had no means of
            rescuing our loved ones.”
        </p>
        <p>
            One particular village, Rambara, about 7 kms (about 4 miles) from Kedarnath temple got wiped off the map.
            <br><br>
            “Nothing is left there ... No houses, no temples,” Guru said.
